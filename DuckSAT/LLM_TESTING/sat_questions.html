<h2>Question 1:</h2>

<div class="passage">Nineteenth-century naturalists along the Atlantic coast often marked the turn of seasons not with instruments but with the arrival of familiar creatures: the first robin on a fence post, the first herring in the nets, the first frogsong carrying over thawing fields. They kept notebooks and almanacs—lists of “firsts” and “lasts”—that modern scientists sometimes dismiss as quaint, imprecise, and unsystematic. The entries rarely describe a method; times are approximate; different observers mix weather notes with gossip. In an age of satellites and standardized protocols, such records can look like noise.

Yet their value is not exhausted by their inaccuracies. These documents reveal how people noticed the world and what they considered meaningful. A diary’s errors are often patterned: a farmer may record more sightings on Sundays because he is home from market, or a schoolteacher’s spring observations cluster around a break from classes. Those patterns can be identified and, to a degree, accounted for by cross-referencing newspapers, church calendars, and other sources. More importantly, they direct our attention to questions we might otherwise neglect: Which cues did communities trust to coordinate plantings and harvests? How did work schedules and social rituals shape exposure to wildlife? Why did certain species become seasonal landmarks while others faded into the background?

Treating these notebooks only as defective thermometers misses their most instructive feature. They are maps of attention—archives of what observers sought and saw. Used with care, they can illuminate both ecological change and the human habits that frame perception. If we ask of them not “How precise are they?” but “What did they make visible, and why?” we gain a richer sense of the past, and perhaps a better guide for what to watch in the present.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which choice best describes the primary purpose of the passage?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>The passage acknowledges that historical observation records are imperfect but argues they are valuable because they reveal how people noticed and interpreted seasonal change. It suggests these diaries can inform present inquiry by highlighting patterns of attention and the social context of observation. Thus, the author’s main aim is not to discard the records or to detail statistical methods, but to reframe their usefulness.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A. To argue that nineteenth-century naturalist records are too unreliable to be useful to modern science
B. To contend that despite their flaws, historical diaries are valuable for what they reveal about observers’ habits and can guide current questions
C. To explain contemporary statistical techniques for correcting biased historical datasets
D. To narrate the life of a particular nineteenth-century naturalist

Correct answer: B</p>

<h2>Question 2:</h2>

<div class="passage">On a summer afternoon, a café owner proudly points to two freshly installed hives on the roof—“We’re helping the bees,” she says, handing out jars of amber honey. The sentiment is common and sincere, but it obscures a complicated reality. Honeybees are domesticated generalists, adept at exploiting abundant floral resources. In cities, where nectar and pollen arrive in pulses—spring street trees bursting, autumn parkland asters—adding large colonies can be like introducing more grazers into a pasture with patchy grass: the strongest will eat first, and others may go hungry. Studies have shown that densely placed honeybee colonies can depress foraging success and reproductive rates of native bees, many of which are solitary, specialized, and already squeezed by habitat loss.

Urban enthusiasm for beekeeping often stems from the visibility of hives and the tangible reward of honey. Habitat, by contrast, is less photogenic and slower to offer proof. Yet the health of urban pollinators depends more on the continuity and diversity of blooms than on the number of boxes perched on rooftops. The café’s decision to remove shrubs to make space for outdoor seating, while adding hives above, encapsulates this mismatch: more mouths, fewer meals.

None of this is to say rooftop hives have no place. Managed wisely and spaced carefully, they can coexist with wild pollinators. But the most effective intervention is to expand and diversify forage—planting native flowering trees and understory, reconnecting small patches of green, and resisting the allure of sterile ornamental landscaping. If we measure success not by jars lined on a shelf but by the quiet abundance of bees we barely notice, we might find cities are already primed to be better habitats—so long as we feed them.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which choice best captures the central claim of the passage?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>The passage argues that while urban beekeeping is well-intentioned, simply adding more honeybee hives can strain limited urban floral resources and harm native pollinators; the more effective strategy is to increase and diversify habitat. This idea appears throughout: the “grazers into a pasture” analogy, the note that high honeybee density can depress native bees, and the emphasis on planting native species and expanding forage. Options that prioritize honey output or deny the feasibility of urban habitats contradict the author’s nuanced stance that hives can “coexist” if managed, but habitat expansion is the key.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A) Urban beekeeping is the most effective solution to pollinator decline. — Incorrect; the passage argues habitat expansion is more effective.
B) Rooftop hives can be beneficial if paired with careful monitoring of honey output. — Incorrect; measuring success by honey jars is explicitly critiqued.
C) Increasing floral habitat and native plant diversity is more helpful than adding more honeybee hives. — Correct.
D) Cities lack sufficient resources to support any pollinator species. — Incorrect; the author says cities can be good habitats if we “feed them.”</p>

<h2>Question 3:</h2>

<div class="passage">In the wind-swept village of Harren Cove, fishermen once swore that a rusted bell lashed to a cliffside rung only on the eve of fierce storms. The sound, low and metallic, drew neighbors to shutter windows and brace hulls, its warning woven into lullabies and weather lore. When a team of acousticians visited last spring, they brought sensors and a polite skepticism. The bell, they explained, resonated not because of hidden spirits or capricious fate but due to pressure waves that precede certain squall lines, setting the metal’s microfractures quivering. The finding was precise and replicable; it also roused a quiet sulk among residents who felt the mystery stripped away.

Yet over the following months, village life bent around the new explanation without snapping. Fishermen began checking barometric readings alongside the bell’s moan; schoolchildren built models that hummed when puffs of air crossed them; the annual Storm Vigil kept its candlelit procession, only now with a brief talk about atmospheric fronts. The bell’s ring did not lose its power to gather the town; it gained a second vocabulary. “If anything,” the principal remarked, “knowing how doesn’t tell us why we listen.”

The acousticians returned to record a documentary and found their diagrams pinned beside recipes for kelp stew. One scientist admitted she had expected hostility, but instead encountered a pragmatic reverence that folded her data into kitchen talk. The legend did not vanish; it was revised. The bell became both omen and instrument, its voice still a cue for care, but now also a lesson in physics. Harren Cove kept its story and acquired a new one: that understanding the mechanism behind a wonder need not diminish the wonder itself.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which choice best expresses the central idea of the passage?

Answers:
A. The bell’s legend was a deliberate hoax designed to attract tourists to Harren Cove.
B. Scientific explanations inevitably erode the cultural value of longstanding traditions.
C. Communities can preserve the meaning of traditions by reframing them in light of evidence.
D. Natural phenomena are too complex for science to explain, so legends are more reliable guides.</p>

<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A. The bell’s legend was a deliberate hoax designed to attract tourists to Harren Cove.
B. Scientific explanations inevitably erode the cultural value of longstanding traditions.
C. Communities can preserve the meaning of traditions by reframing them in light of evidence.
D. Natural phenomena are too complex for science to explain, so legends are more reliable guides.

Explanation:
Choice C is correct. The passage shows Harren Cove adopting the acousticians’ findings while maintaining the bell’s communal significance: fishermen consult barometric readings, children build models, and the Storm Vigil continues with added scientific context. This illustrates that tradition can be reframed to incorporate evidence without losing meaning. Choice A is unsupported; there is no suggestion of a hoax or tourism motive. Choice B contradicts the passage, which explicitly shows cultural value enduring alongside scientific explanation. Choice D misrepresents the author’s view; the acousticians do explain the phenomenon, and the village values both the scientific account and the legend.</p>

<h2>Question 4:</h2>

<div class="passage">When I first opened the cracked leather boxes that housed the botanist’s field notes, I expected to meet a mind as immaculate as the pressed alpine flowers tucked between pages. The legend was familiar: a tireless cataloger, sternly methodical, who laid order upon unruly slopes. Yet the handwriting that wandered across rain-stained paper suggested something less tidy. He made careful lists, yes, but also confessions—of miscounted petals, of specimens lost to wind, of his own impatience when a hillside yielded neither novelty nor certainty. The temptation was to ignore these hesitations, to polish his legacy until it gleamed without seams. But a good archive resists hagiography. My task was not to crown him but to understand him.

As I annotated the notebooks, I learned to temper my impulse to canonize him. Admiration needed ballast: dates checked against weather reports, identifications cross-referenced with later corrections, claims nested within the threadbare conditions under which they were made. In the margins, I kept adding counterweights—“see revision in 1893,” “specimen mislabeled?”—not to diminish the botanist, but to let him stand on the ground he actually trod. The result felt messier than the legend, but also more human. Perfection was never his subject; persistence was. He returned to the same ridge year after year, aware that certainty would slink away at the slightest disturbance, and still he walked, bent to the task.

Readers sometimes ask whether the notes betray the myth. I prefer to think they complete it. A record that admits its doubts invites trust. If we wish to honor the work, we must honor the conditions of its making—the cold, the errors, the second thoughts—and allow admiration to be honest, weighted, and true.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> In the sentence “As I annotated the notebooks, I learned to temper my impulse to canonize him,” the word “temper” most nearly means</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>In context, the narrator describes resisting the urge to idealize the botanist and instead balancing admiration with evidence and skepticism: “Admiration needed ballast,” “adding counterweights,” and “not to diminish the botanist, but to let him stand on the ground he actually trod.” These phrases show that “temper” means to moderate or restrain the impulse, not to harden metal, provoke anger, or dilute in a literal sense. Therefore, “temper” most nearly means to moderate or mitigate.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A) to harden by heating and cooling
B) to dilute
C) to moderate or restrain
D) to provoke to anger</p>

<h2>Question 5:</h2>

<div class="passage">The first meeting about revitalizing the old train depot was packed—neighbors leaned against the walls, balancing paper cups of coffee, eager to volunteer for everything from plastering to fundraising. As the new coordinator, I barely had time to sit before the agenda filled itself: a mural, a reading room, a weekly market, all by summer. The energy was intoxicating, and I found myself nodding along until my pen hovered over the timeline column and refused to move. I remembered the last neighborhood project that collapsed under the weight of its own exuberance—how deadlines slid, invoices accumulated, volunteers burned out, and, by autumn, hope itself had become a liability.

So when the floor opened for comments, I chose my words carefully. “We must temper our hopes with realistic timelines and budgets,” I said, mindful of how quickly caution is mistaken for cynicism. A few faces tightened, but others softened; if enthusiasm was the spark, prudence would be the fuel. We discussed permits and insurance, phased construction, the need to consult the city about historical protections. By the end of the hour, the mural had become a single panel we could complete with local artists, the reading room a modest alcove stocked by donations, the market a monthly test run rather than a weekly promise.

No one left elated, but no one left deflated either. Outside, under a sky that threatened rain without delivering it, a volunteer murmured that restraint would save us in the long run. I agreed. To temper desire is not to diminish it, but to fit it to what the world, and we, can bear.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> As used in the sentence “We must temper our hopes with realistic timelines and budgets,” the word “temper” most nearly means</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>In context, the speaker is urging the group to balance enthusiasm with practical constraints. The discussion that follows replaces ambitious goals with phased, attainable steps, indicating that “temper” means to moderate or make less extreme. It does not mean to harden (which would suggest making hopes more rigid or intense), to dilute (which implies weakening them into insignificance), or to anger (which doesn’t fit the idea of aligning hopes with practicality). “Moderate” best captures the sense of regulating or balancing optimism with realism.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A) harden
B) dilute
C) moderate
D) anger

Correct answer: C</p>

<h2>Question 6:</h2>

<div class="passage">When the last full-service grocery closed on the south side, residents responded with ingenuity rather than resignation. Retired teachers set up folding tables under elm trees, offering tomatoes and eggs sourced from relatives in the countryside; teenagers stacked crates of kale beside bus stops, trading bundles for small bills and IOUs. These makeshift markets were messy but vital, filling a gap with speed no formal chain could match. They also operated in a legal gray area: neither strictly prohibited nor explicitly protected, they were tolerated until someone complained.

Into that ambiguity stepped City Hall. The mayor convened a working group of health inspectors, neighborhood leaders, and small-business advocates, and within a month released a draft ordinance. The proposal would sanction these small-scale enterprises while establishing guardrails—requiring handwashing stations, labeling origins, and limiting cluster sizes to prevent bottlenecks at crowded intersections. To skeptics, the word “sanction” sounded ominous, a prelude to fines or bureaucratic scolding. But the accompanying measures told a different story: streamlined, no-cost permits; liability coverage pooled through a nonprofit; and training sessions hosted at the library on safe food handling and bookkeeping.

The city’s approach, at once pragmatic and aspirational, recognized that informal solutions are often first responders to structural problems. Rather than smother the stalls with enforcement, it sought to temper their risks and amplify their usefulness. That distinction matters in a community wary of being policed rather than served. If the ordinance passes, the markets will not lose their spontaneity; they will gain a scaffold—light enough to preserve their agility, sturdy enough to keep them from collapsing under the weight of their own success.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> As used in the passage, “sanction” most nearly means

A) penalize
B) authorize
C) publicize
D) monitor</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>The passage explains that the city’s proposal would “sanction these small-scale enterprises while establishing guardrails” and then details supportive actions: issuing streamlined, no-cost permits, providing liability coverage, and offering training. These steps indicate official approval and permission, not punishment. Therefore, “sanction” here most nearly means authorize. Choice A (penalize) conflicts with the described supportive measures. Choice C (publicize) is not supported; the focus is on permits and guidelines, not publicity. Choice D (monitor) is partially related to “guardrails,” but the core meaning of “sanction” in this context is granting formal approval.</p>

<h2>Question 7:</h2>

<div class="passage">The map on my office wall has pins crawling toward the county line. Each week, our blue van leaves the library lot like a hopeful comet, slinging itself down roads that aren’t on GPS. At the feed store, we set up on overturned buckets, pass dog-eared paperbacks, watch kids try to exchange jar lids for comic books. People insist on paying; we take peaches instead. The only place you’ll find our schedule printed is a single flyer taped to the hardware store register, already softened by thumbprints. Word spreads in stitched lines: a cousin tells a neighbor who tells a sister.

One email, from a foundation officer in the city, arrives with language like metrics and scalability. He offers a tidy grant if we’ll adopt a barcoded inventory, online reservations, a route announced weeks ahead. I reread his message between calls about a washed-out culvert and Mrs. Bell’s ankle. When I picture our van committing to an online calendar, I also picture promises we can’t keep when rain turns the dirt to marrow. We made this work because we know who milks at dawn, whose trailer takes a left after the cottonwood, whose boy will lose interest unless you hand him the book yourself.

It’s not that I believe money ruins things. It’s that when you set a clock on the kind of help that flows along conversations and kitchen tables, you pull it out of the river and nail it in place. A nailed thing doesn’t bend when the bridge disappears overnight. So I type a polite reply and tuck the offer beside the map, and the pins keep moving, not glamorous, not polished, but inching outward all the same.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which inference about the narrator’s view of the foundation’s proposal is best supported by the passage?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>The narrator acknowledges that “money” is not inherently bad but worries that the proposed systems—barcodes, online reservations, fixed schedules—would “pull [the help] out of the river and nail it in place,” making it less flexible and less responsive to local, unpredictable conditions (e.g., washed-out roads, varying routines, the need for personal handoffs). This indicates concern that formalizing the program would undermine its adaptability to the community’s needs. The narrator never suggests residents want online systems, nor plans statewide expansion, and explicitly imagines “promises we can’t keep,” contradicting the idea that there are no significant drawbacks.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A) The narrator thinks the foundation’s grant would provide necessary resources without any significant drawbacks.
B) The narrator fears that formalizing the program could erode its responsiveness to local needs.
C) The narrator believes residents would prefer an online reservation system.
D) The narrator plans to expand the program across the entire state within the year.</p>

<h2>Question 8:</h2>

<div class="passage">To: Board of Trustees
From: Mara Klein, Curator
Subject: Proposed Marine Microfossils Exhibit

Before anyone pictures swarming lines and televisions parked on our lawn, let me be clear about the scale of the traveling exhibit I’m recommending. The microfossils collection is, by design, intimate. Visitors look through binocular scopes at grains of sand revealed as miniature architecture; the largest object is a shoebox-sized sediment core. The vendor’s contract caps daily attendance at 500, partly to protect their specimens, partly to reassure hosts like us. Insurance is bundled, provided we adhere to basic crowd controls.

I’m aware that, since last spring, the board has had no appetite for “spectacle.” The phrase appeared in minutes, and it’s not wrong to be cautious. The tidepool demonstration brought us numbers we hadn’t planned for; at one point, our docents were running a line rather than a lesson. We did not have injuries, but we did have a day that felt more like a festival than a class. If letters to the editor accused us of chasing turnout, they also asked whether anyone learned something.

This proposal anticipates that concern. The scopes are few by intention. The vendor provides two facilitators whose job is to pace sessions, not hype them. I have asked our education staff to prioritize school groups over drop-ins, which we can manage with timed blocks. For those worried about budgets, note that the state science council’s grant covers logistics if we demonstrate measurable engagement: we will track dwell time at each station, and we will not be graded on the raw headcount. I believe the exhibit aligns with our mission without inviting the kind of excitement that eclipses it.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which inference is most supported by the passage about the board’s response to last spring’s event?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>The curator notes that the board has “no appetite for ‘spectacle’” and that the previous tidepool demonstration “felt more like a festival than a class,” with docents “running a line rather than a lesson.” She also mentions letters accusing the museum of “chasing turnout” and asking whether anyone learned something. These details suggest the board was concerned that high-profile events emphasizing crowd size detracted from the museum’s educational mission, rather than that the event caused damage or personnel changes. The memo’s emphasis on controlled attendance and measured engagement directly addresses those concerns.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A. They objected primarily because vandalism raised insurance premiums.
B. They were critical of events that prioritized attracting crowds over education. [Correct]
C. They demanded the curator resign after the event.
D. They were indifferent, treating the event as routine.</p>

<h2>Question 9:</h2>

<div class="passage">On Tuesday nights I volunteer at the tiny museum tucked behind the bait shop, the one whose displays are anchored by brass screws and Ruth’s looping handwriting. Last winter we received a grant to “modernize visitor engagement,” and the consultant the board hired flew in with a suitcase of touchscreens and phrases like “attention economies” that sounded like tides, but did not move.

Tourists come because the ferry makes us a convenient pause—an hour to warm their hands and let the wind lift their hair before another itinerary. Children press their noses to the glass case with the dented compass, and they laugh when the needle quivers. I watched Ruth—eighty-two, scarf knotted neatly even in July—smile at them and then pull that scarf tighter when the consultant explained how uploading stories would “scale our reach.”

If you look closely at Ruth’s labels, you can see where the pen line wobbles on the word “home,” the winter after her husband died. She cut small pieces of museum board from cereal boxes in those years because the county budget was a rumor and she was stubborn. I remember reading her placard about a fisherman’s skiff lost in a blue norther when I was seventeen and feeling, inexplicably, seen.

At the meeting, the consultant asked for a vote, and the board shifted on metal chairs. Ruth said, “I won’t be here forever,” and nodded at the compass. “You can upload a story. Can you steady a hand?” We piloted two screens and agreed the labels would remain until we had “data.” Outside, the wind worried the flag. I thought about boats and bandwidth, about what a hand can hold and what a screen can absorb before it dims.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which statement is most strongly supported by the passage?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>The narrator repeatedly contrasts the consultant’s digital proposals with the tangible, human qualities of the museum’s existing displays, especially Ruth’s handwritten labels and the dented compass. The narrator notes the wobble in Ruth’s pen after her husband died and recalls feeling “seen” by a placard as a teenager, suggesting a belief that the physical artifacts and the human touch they carry provide a meaningful connection that digitization might miss. Ruth’s comment (“You can upload a story. Can you steady a hand?”) underscores this concern, and the narrator’s final reflection on “what a hand can hold and what a screen can absorb” further supports it. The board does not reject updates outright; they pilot screens while keeping labels, and Ruth does not demand the grant be rejected. Therefore, the best-supported statement is that the narrator worries digitization may overlook the human touch embodied in the current exhibits.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A. The narrator is primarily excited by the new grant and wants the handwritten placards completely replaced.
B. The narrator worries that digitization may overlook the human touch embodied in the existing exhibits.
C. Ruth opposes any updates and insists the museum reject the grant.
D. The board unanimously rejects the consultant’s proposal to add screens.</p>

<h2>Question 10:</h2>

<div class="passage">City planners often tout green roofs—vegetated layers atop buildings—as a climate panacea. Their shading and evapotranspiration can cool rooftops by up to 40°F, reduce stormwater runoff, and offer pockets of habitat. Yet the appeal of a universally applicable solution is misleading. The cooling benefit rarely extends beyond the roofline; street-level temperatures in dense districts change little unless green roofs are coupled with shade trees or reflective pavements. In arid cities, irrigation for green roofs can offset heat gains with water strain, while in cold regions structural retrofits to bear saturated soil add embodied carbon that can erase short-term gains. The equity calculus can be skewed: maintenance fees are often passed to tenants who may never access these rooftops, even as parks at grade remain underfunded. Some studies find biodiversity uplift, but the species favored are generalists already thriving elsewhere; without native plant palettes and connectivity, roofs can become isolated islands.

None of this argues against green roofs. They shine when used for targeted outcomes—stormwater management in combined-sewer neighborhoods, insulation on mid-rise buildings with favorable load capacity, or microhabitats along migratory flyways. But elevating them as a singular fix distracts from cheaper, context-sensitive steps: planting street trees to shade pedestrians, painting dark surfaces with high-albedo coatings, or revising zoning to reduce heat-trapping parking lots. A portfolio mindset—matching interventions to local climate, infrastructure, and social needs—will deliver more durable benefits than any single technology marketed as a cure-all.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which choice best captures the central claim of the passage?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>Choice B is correct because the author argues that while green roofs offer genuine benefits, they should not be treated as a universal solution. The passage emphasizes context and complementary strategies: cooling rarely reaches street level unless paired with trees or reflective pavements; irrigation and structural retrofits can undermine gains depending on climate; and equity concerns arise when costs burden tenants. The author ultimately recommends a “portfolio mindset,” using green roofs selectively for targeted outcomes alongside other locally suitable measures.

Choice A is too absolute and contradicts the passage’s insistence that benefits are limited and context-dependent. Choice C overemphasizes cost and structural constraints; those are supporting considerations but not the passage’s main point, which is about strategic, context-sensitive deployment. Choice D misrepresents the biodiversity discussion; the author notes that biodiversity gains can be limited and require specific plant palettes and connectivity, not that they outweigh drawbacks.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A) Green roofs are the most effective way to reduce urban heat across all cities.
B) Green roofs can be valuable, but only when used selectively alongside other strategies tailored to local conditions.
C) The primary barrier to adopting green roofs is their cost and structural requirements.
D) Biodiversity benefits from green roofs generally outweigh any drawbacks.

<h2>Question 11:</h2>

<div class="passage">Urban planners often celebrate neighborhoods with high “walkability scores,” which typically tally how many stores, parks, and transit stops lie within a quarter- or half-mile radius. By this logic, proximity equals access. Yet anyone who has tried to walk with a stroller across a six-lane arterial, or searched for shade on a blistering afternoon, knows that distance alone does not determine whether walking is feasible—or desirable.

In our review of two adjacent districts with identical walkability scores, the district bisected by wide, fast roads recorded 28% fewer pedestrian trips during peak hours. The difference wasn’t mystery but micro-condition: crossings with 90-second signal cycles, curb ramps misaligned with crosswalks, and sidewalks narrowed by utility poles. Municipal injury reports associated the same district with 17% more trip-and-fall incidents per mile, largely attributed to buckled slabs and uneven joints. Parents in a separate survey said they avoided routes near schools not because destinations were far, but because drivers routinely rolled through stop signs; 64% cited “inconsistent crossing protection” as a deterrent.

Comfort matters, too. Shade trees and seating appeared trivial in spreadsheets but turned out to be decisive for older adults: bench spacing under 500 feet correlated with longer continuous walking bouts, while segments lacking shade saw walking volumes drop on hot days. Noise played a role: blocks with heavy truck traffic—despite abundant destinations—experienced reduced pedestrian linger time, which weakens local commerce.

This evidence suggests our metrics should shift from counting nearby places to assessing how possible it is to reach them safely and pleasantly. A refined index would incorporate crossing delay, surface quality, traffic speed, shade continuity, seating frequency, and noise levels. Without such a recalibration, cities risk investing in new shops and stops while leaving the routes between them hostile—an arithmetic of access that looks good on paper but fails at street level.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which choice best states the central claim of the passage?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>The passage argues that traditional walkability metrics equate proximity with access, but this approach overlooks crucial “micro-conditions” that determine whether walking is safe and comfortable. The author supports this claim with data and examples: identical walkability scores paired with 28% fewer pedestrian trips, increased injuries from uneven sidewalks, parents deterred by unsafe crossings, and the impact of shade, seating, and noise on walking behavior. The conclusion calls for revising metrics to include factors like crossing delay, surface quality, and shade. Therefore, the best answer is the choice that emphasizes shifting from simple counts of nearby destinations to evaluating the quality of the routes.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A. Neighborhood walkability is best measured by the number of destinations within a short distance.
B. Walkability is inherently subjective and cannot be quantified meaningfully.
C. Focusing solely on proximity masks critical route conditions, so walkability metrics must account for safety and comfort features.
D. Cities should prioritize adding more shops and transit stops rather than improving sidewalks and crossings.

Correct answer: C</p>

<h2>Question 12:</h2>

<div class="passage">Contrary to the oft-repeated claim that the internet has rendered public libraries obsolete, libraries have quietly broadened their mission in ways that make them more—not less—central to civic life. Yes, they still lend books. But their core function has shifted from simply dispersing materials to facilitating access: to trustworthy information, to digital tools, and to community support that many residents cannot otherwise afford. In a rural county where home broadband is unreliable, library Wi-Fi extends into parking lots after hours and enables job applications, telehealth appointments, and schoolwork. In a city where rising costs squeeze household budgets, the library’s makerspace replaces expensive software licenses with free design tools and workshops. When a local plant closes, librarians convert a reading room into a résumé lab and coach laid-off workers through job portals that are bewildering without guidance.

Libraries also buffer communities against the social consequences of misinformation. Staff curate media-literacy sessions, teach patrons how to evaluate sources, and help them navigate government sites that are labyrinthine even to experienced users. During extreme heat waves and storms, branches serve as cooling and charging centers, their roles expanding from cultural institutions to resilience hubs. None of this erases the library’s traditional identity; rather, it reframes it. The shelves remain, but they are framed by classes, clinics, and conversations that reflect an updated understanding of what it means to be informed and connected. If a library is a place where knowledge meets need, then the internet has not replaced it—it has raised the stakes of its work, demanding spaces where people can find not just data, but guidance, reliability, and a neighborly hand.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which choice best states the main idea of the passage?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>The passage argues that modern libraries are more central to civic life than ever because they have expanded beyond lending books to meet a range of community needs—digital access, job assistance, media literacy, and disaster resilience. Details such as Wi-Fi reaching parking lots, makerspaces offering free tools, résumé labs for displaced workers, and branches serving as cooling and charging centers all support the claim that libraries have adapted into multi-functional community hubs. Choice B captures this evolution and emphasis on adaptability. Choice A claims libraries have been replaced and must fight for relevance, which the passage explicitly rejects (“the internet has not replaced it—it has raised the stakes of its work”). Choice C narrows the focus to makerspaces, treating one example as the main point, which misses the broader argument. Choice D prescribes a singular focus on combating misinformation, whereas the passage presents multiple, balanced roles—including lending, access, training, and resilience—rather than advocating exclusivity.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A. Public libraries have been replaced by digital platforms and must fight for relevance.
B. While once primarily book lenders, modern libraries serve as adaptable community hubs meeting civic and informational needs.
C. Makerspaces are the most important innovation in libraries because they teach patrons to use advanced tools.
D. Library staff should focus exclusively on countering misinformation rather than lending materials.</p>

<h2>Question 13:</h2>

<div class="passage">At a city museum, I paused before a placard that read “Invented by Alfred Reynolds, 1893.” The object—a compact, gleaming bicycle—seemed to sit under the weight of that single name. It is a familiar weight. We like to anchor devices to lone figures, to simplify tangled histories into a tidy origin story and a hero who mattered most.

But compressing a lineage into a lone credit blurs the messy accumulation by which tools take shape. Consider the bicycle itself. Karl Drais’s early nineteenth-century “draisine” supplied a steerable frame; others added pedals to free riders from pushing against the ground; still others experimented with chain drives to make effort more efficient and with inflatable tires to make motion smoother. Manufacturing techniques lowered costs; urban road improvements shifted demand; postal routes, factory commutes, and weekend leisure routines pressed inventors and tinkerers to solve different problems at different times. No single refinement suddenly birthed “the bicycle.” Instead, each intervention nudged the machine closer to something recognizable today, and the nudges were distributed across decades, professions, and continents.

If our labels pretend otherwise, we don’t just misremember; we misread what innovation is. Stories that jump from “before” to “after,” with a name inserted between, make progress feel like a shut door opened by a single keyholder. That narrative obscures apprenticeships, borrowed ideas, commercial pressures, and experiments that failed but taught. It also encourages a kind of accounting that prizes patents and overlooks communities.

Museums can keep placards simple without keeping them singular. A card that lists a small chain of contributors, a date range, and the conditions that made adoption possible would honor both the object and the network that assembled it. The point is not to erase Alfred Reynolds, but to let the bicycle return to a lineage rather than a silhouette.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which choice best describes how the author organizes the passage?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>The passage opens with a specific museum label to introduce the common “lone inventor” narrative. The author then challenges that narrative by tracing the bicycle’s development through a series of distributed contributions and contextual forces. Finally, the author proposes a practical change to museum labels to better reflect collaborative innovation. This structure moves from anecdote to critique supported by example, concluding with a recommendation.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A) Begins with an anecdote that introduces a common assumption, challenges it with a historical example of cumulative innovation, and concludes by proposing a change in how credit is assigned.
B) Presents a strict chronological timeline of bicycle inventions from the nineteenth century and ends by predicting future technological trends.
C) Lists the advantages and disadvantages of giving sole credit to inventors and ultimately argues that disadvantages outweigh advantages.
D) Offers two opposing views on innovation—individual vs. collective—without indicating which the author prefers.</p>

<h2>Question 14:</h2>

<div class="passage">On a spring afternoon, a rooftop beekeeper in the city lifts a frame slick with honey and mutters, half triumphant, half sheepish, when a yellow notice flaps on the stairwell door: violation. To passersby, the bees are evidence that nature can thrive in concrete; to inspectors, they are an unmanaged hazard. The tension is not accidental. Urban ecosystems are built as much by policy as by pollinators.

A decade ago, many municipalities treated beekeeping as a quaint nuisance. Bans were blunt instruments meant to forestall stings, swarms, and lawsuits. Yet as news of pollinator decline spread and community gardens multiplied, hives reappeared—sometimes sanctioned, often not—on balconies and rooftops. The city did not so much invite bees as discover they were already present in walls, parks, and utility lots. The question became not whether bees belonged but how to acknowledge their presence without courting panic.

Two models emerged. One relies on prohibition, reasoning that fewer hives mean fewer incidents. It promises clarity—no hives, no problems—but ignores that bees don’t read ordinances and that clandestine practice tends to be careless. The other model builds oversight: permits tied to training, placement rules that keep flight paths above head height, and inspections that make sure water sources and swarm plans exist. This approach admits the unavoidable and tries to reduce friction. Cities that link beekeeping to green-roof incentives or schoolyard science report fewer complaints precisely because expectations are established.

The rooftop notice is a symptom of a policy caught between spectacle and systems. Are bees charming interlopers or infrastructural residents? When regulation treats them as either pure novelty or pure nuisance, it creates the very unpredictability it fears. The point is not to romanticize honey but to align civic caution with ecological reality: where living things persist, governance should prefer shaping practice over pretending abstinence will suffice.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which choice best describes how the author structures the passage to advance its central claim?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>The passage opens with a specific anecdote (the rooftop beekeeper receiving a violation notice) to illustrate a broader tension between urban nature and regulation. It then provides brief historical context about shifting municipal attitudes toward beekeeping, followed by a contrast between two regulatory models (prohibition versus oversight). Finally, it concludes by arguing for governance that shapes practice rather than bans, tying the anecdote back to the broader claim. The passage does not primarily rely on statistics, offer unrelated anecdotes, or reject a policy without alternatives.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A) Begins with a concrete example to introduce a broader conflict, then contrasts policy approaches to argue for a structured, oversight-based solution. [Correct]
B) Starts with statistical evidence, then critiques its validity before proposing an experimental trial.
C) Strings together unrelated anecdotes to entertain rather than persuade, ending without a clear position.
D) Summarizes a single policy and dismisses it outright without presenting other options.</p>

<h2>Question 15:</h2>

<div class="passage">On a gray Tuesday afternoon, the library’s second-floor conference room hums with the soft whirr of a 3D printer. A teenager leans over a laptop, tweaking the design of a prosthetic finger; across the table, a retiree learns to solder a loose wire. Their work is meticulous, their conversation quiet—but it is not silent in the way we imagine libraries to be. The scene is an affront to nostalgia and, at the same time, a fulfillment of it.

Libraries have long been misremembered as temples of hush, their value measured in decibels rather than in doors opened. In practice, their central promise has always been access: to information, to skills, to community. The machines and tools now wedged between stacks are not intrusions but extensions of that promise, broadening who can learn and what can be made.

Skeptics insist that makerspaces and media labs dilute the sanctuary libraries provide for readers, that the buzz of activity dislodges quiet contemplation. The concern is not frivolous; a refuge should feel like one. Yet the fear mistakes means for ends. Quiet, like cataloging, is a tactic—useful, but not the mission. Many libraries designate zones and hours, partitioning sound just as they partition genres. Librarians orchestrate the environment with the same care they apply to collections: balancing needs, curating tools, teaching etiquette.

If anything, the new rooms restore an older vision. Early public libraries offered lecture halls and workshops alongside reading rooms, understanding that literacy grows in many directions. Today’s equipment is simply the contemporary shelf: a printer that shows design, a studio that teaches voice, a kit that reveals circuitry. The hum you hear is not disorder but practice. It is the sound of people learning, together, in a place meant for exactly that.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which choice best describes how the author organizes the passage to advance its central purpose?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>The passage begins with a concrete, vivid scene that challenges a familiar stereotype, then broadens into an argument that reframes the library’s mission around access rather than silence. The author acknowledges a counterargument (concerns about noise), concedes its validity in part, and then refutes it by redefining quiet as a tactic and explaining practical solutions (zones, hours, etiquette). Finally, the passage synthesizes past and present, invoking historical precedent to reinforce the redefinition and concluding with a metaphor that aligns modern tools with traditional collections. This structure—anecdote, contrast, concession/refutation, historical context, synthesis—serves the purpose of persuading readers to view makerspaces as consistent with libraries’ core mission.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A. The author opens with a specific anecdote, contrasts traditional perceptions with current functions, addresses and refutes a counterargument, and concludes by synthesizing past and present to reframe the institution’s mission. 
B. The author presents a chronological history from the founding of public libraries to the present, culminating in a call for increased funding. 
C. The author marshals statistical evidence and expert testimony to prove that noise levels do not affect reading comprehension. 
D. The author offers a series of loosely connected vignettes about library patrons, leaving the reader to infer the broader point.</p>

<h2>Question 16:</h2>

<div class="passage">On the city map, blocks shaded gray signal “vacant.” It is a tidy word, a bureaucrat’s sigh. But vacancy is not a neutral label; it is a narrative about what counts and who counts. A lot filled with milkweed and wind is marked as nothing. A stoop where a neighbor rests, a chalk drawing that fades by dusk—these are erased by a single color. Who decides what is useful? Who decides what is seen?

We mistake quiet for emptiness, pause for abandonment. We make a habit of overlooking what takes time to ripen, then call it waste. If the soil remembers seeds scattered by last year’s hands, is that memory “vacant”? If a block hums at noon and hushes by evening, is that hush “vacant”? The word trains our eyes to skip, to pass, to hurry through.

The organizers of the new garden did not change the lots; they changed the story. They did not import value but uncovered it, pulling up trash bags and finding, under them, the beginnings of a path. They called volunteers by name and the earth by name, too—clover, worm, stone. Vacancy, then, is the city holding its breath. Exhale, and the block is a choir.

It is tempting to think that only new buildings can give shape to a street. But some shapes are made of time, some of attention. A bench or a bed of basil can stitch a corner back into the fabric, as surely as steel can. If “vacant” is a way of not looking, then to look—closely, patiently—is already to build.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> In the sentence “Vacancy, then, is the city holding its breath,” the author most likely employs personification to achieve which rhetorical effect?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>By describing vacancy as the city “holding its breath,” the author reframes emptiness as a temporary, expectant pause rather than a permanent deficit. This personification suggests latent potential and prepares readers to accept the idea that attention and community action can “exhale” and animate the space. It strengthens the call to reimagine “vacant” lots as sites of possibility rather than decay.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A) It romanticizes neglect, undermining the urgency of revitalization.
B) It recasts absence as a suspended moment of potential, encouraging readers to envision transformation. (Correct)
C) It contrasts privately owned property with public space to highlight inequity.
D) It implies that municipal bureaucracy is deliberately stifling neighborhood progress.</p>

<h2>Question 17:</h2>

<div class="passage">When we first pried up the buckled asphalt of the abandoned lot, we kept a ledger of our triumphs. Five cubic yards of rubble hauled, twelve beds built, sixty-seven seedlings tucked into soil that had not known tenderness in decades. The city applauded our efficiency; a district memo praised the project for “maximizing underutilized space,” as if basil could be reduced to a spreadsheet cell.

And yet the ledger did not hear the low, insistently gentle hum of bees. It did not notice Mrs. Alvarez, who came each evening to sit on a milk crate and tell stories about her childhood orchard, her voice threading through the tomato trellises like a second vine. It did not count the conversations that sprouted along the fence line, where strangers traded recipes and names. We keep measuring what we can carry, water, harvest. But what is the algebra for trust? What, then, is a garden if not a small uprising?

Against the relentless arithmetic of worth—square feet, return on investment, projected yield—the garden refuses to be merely productive. It is messy, inefficient, and flagrantly generous. A boy forgets to turn off the hose; a neighbor brings cuttings with no labels; a volunteer plants marigolds “just because,” disrupting the neat rows with pockets of brightness. The district memo has no category for “just because.” We plant anyway.

None of this is to dismiss the facts: the garden feeds families, supplements budgets, cools the summer air. But the harvest that matters most cannot be bagged or weighed. It is the recalibration of attention, the reminder that value is not always a sum. When a place once defined by absence begins to call people to show up for each other, numbers, for once, fall silent—and that silence is its loudest argument.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> In the sentence “What, then, is a garden if not a small uprising?”, the author’s use of a rhetorical question primarily serves to</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>The question reframes the garden from a merely utilitarian space into a symbolic act of resistance against a narrowly quantitative mindset. By asking readers to consider the garden as “a small uprising,” the author challenges the memo’s metric-driven values and invites a conceptual shift: the garden opposes the “relentless arithmetic of worth” by embodying community, generosity, and attention. It does not admit uncertainty or suggest illegality, and the comparison is figurative, not a claim that gardening is literally political rebellion.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A) Undermine the author’s credibility by admitting uncertainty
B) Challenge the metric-driven perspective by recasting the garden as an act of resistance
C) Imply that the garden violates official regulations
D) Present a literal comparison between gardening and political revolution</p>

<h2>Question 18:</h2>

<div class="passage">At dusk, the river makes a mirror of our town, duplicating roofs and trees and the one crooked path that runs down to the water’s edge. Where the old footbridge once arched, people still pause—out of habit, perhaps—and then retrace their steps to the nearest street crossing, adding twenty minutes to what used to be a two-minute drift across planks and sky. We have been told that rebuilding the bridge is not “essential,” that its absence is an inconvenience rather than an injury. But what counts as essential when the thing missing is not merely a shortcut but a meeting place?

What is a town if not an agreement to meet halfway? A bridge is the physical grammar of that promise: you step toward me, I step toward you, and we arrive together at a span built by hands we may never shake. Opponents tally columns and costs. They are not wrong to mind the budget; numbers keep the lights on. Yet no one writes poems to asphalt. We remember what makes a place feel like something more than coordinates on a map.

We are not merely pouring concrete; we are laying a promise. Fixing the footbridge will not fix everything—we will still disagree about schools and trash collection and the location of the summer festival—but it will reassert a habit of approaching rather than avoiding. The price of neglect is not just measured in dollars saved; it is counted in detours taken, in the days and evenings when the far bank remains a rumor. Let us build the span again—not because it is glamorous, but because it is ordinary, and the ordinary undergirds the exceptional.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> In the sentence “What is a town if not an agreement to meet halfway?,” the author primarily uses a rhetorical question to achieve which effect?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>The rhetorical question reframes the debate from a narrow consideration of cost and utility to a broader reflection on communal identity and shared values. By inviting readers to supply the answer, the author transforms the footbridge from a mere infrastructure project into a symbol of civic reciprocity, thereby elevating the stakes and encouraging readers to view the bridge as integral to the town’s social fabric rather than optional. Choices that emphasize technical detail, concession, or dismissal of compromise misread the sentence’s function, which is aspirational and value-laden rather than argumentative on budgetary specifics.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A. Reinforce fiscal pragmatism by narrowing the definition of “essential services.”
B. Recast the bridge as a symbol of communal commitment, shifting focus from utility to shared values.
C. Undermine the proposal’s credibility by admitting the plan lacks concrete details.
D. Suggest that compromise on funding is unnecessary because the moral case is self-evident.

<h2>Question 19:</h2>

<div class="passage">Data table description (City neighborhoods, median household income and percentage of workers commuting by public transit):
- Neighborhood A: Income 2010 $50,000; Income 2020 $65,000; Transit 2010 22%; Transit 2020 28%
- Neighborhood B: Income 2010 $60,000; Income 2020 $63,000; Transit 2010 35%; Transit 2020 32%
- Neighborhood C: Income 2010 $45,000; Income 2020 $52,000; Transit 2010 18%; Transit 2020 25%
- Neighborhood D: Income 2010 $80,000; Income 2020 $95,000; Transit 2010 40%; Transit 2020 46%

Passage text:
A city planner writes, “From 2010 to 2020, median household income rose in all four neighborhoods, and the areas with the greatest income gains saw the most pronounced increases in public transit commuting. This pattern suggests that rising incomes drive higher rates of public transit use.”</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which choice best evaluates the city planner’s conclusion in light of the data?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>Income increased in all four neighborhoods, but the magnitude of transit change varies:
- A: Income +$15,000; Transit +6 percentage points (22% to 28%).
- B: Income +$3,000; Transit −3 points (35% to 32%).
- C: Income +$7,000; Transit +7 points (18% to 25%).
- D: Income +$15,000; Transit +6 points (40% to 46%).

Neighborhoods with the largest income gains (A and D, +$15,000) did see increases in transit use (+6 points each). However, the largest increase in transit use occurred in C (+7 points), which had a smaller income gain than A and D. Thus, the data partially support the planner’s claim (higher incomes often coincide with higher transit use) but do not show that the greatest income gains produced the most pronounced increases.

Correct answer: A</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A. Partially supported: Neighborhoods with the largest income gains (A and D) did see increases in transit commuting, but the greatest transit increase occurred in C, which had a smaller income gain.
B. Fully supported: The neighborhoods with the greatest income gains had the largest increases in transit commuting, and all other neighborhoods had smaller or negative changes.
C. Not supported: Neighborhoods with the largest income gains saw decreases in transit commuting.
D. Unsupported: The data show no relationship between changes in income and changes in transit commuting.</p>

<h2>Question 20:</h2>

<div class="passage">Table: Selected Commuting and Remote Work Indicators by City, 2019 and 2024
City | Avg weekly commuting time (min), 2019 | Avg weekly commuting time (min), 2024 | Percent remote ≥3 days/week, 2019 | Percent remote ≥3 days/week, 2024 | Avg weekly bus ridership (thousands), 2019 | Avg weekly bus ridership (thousands), 2024
Milltown | 210 | 168 | 10% | 45% | 120 | 80
Riverton | 180 | 162 | 8% | 30% | 90 | 95
Ashbury | 200 | 150 | 12% | 40% | 150 | 110
Glenview | 160 | 140 | 5% | 22% | 70 | 72

In an op-ed, a transit analyst argues that as remote work becomes more common, average weekly commuting time tends to fall across mid-sized cities. However, the analyst cautions that bus ridership does not uniformly decline: in places that upgraded service—adding express routes and improving frequency—ridership can rise even while remote work expands. He also notes that the cities with the sharpest drops in commute time are not necessarily those with the biggest increases in remote work.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which statement is most directly supported by the data in the table?
A. Ashbury’s bus ridership declined by a greater percentage than Milltown’s between 2019 and 2024.
B. Among the four cities, Ashbury had the largest reduction in average weekly commute time.
C. Riverton’s increase in remote work adoption was equal to Glenview’s.
D. Across all four cities, greater increases in remote work adoption always corresponded to decreases in bus ridership.</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>- Compute commute-time changes: Milltown decreased by 42 minutes (210 to 168), Riverton by 18 (180 to 162), Ashbury by 50 (200 to 150), Glenview by 20 (160 to 140). Ashbury’s drop (50) is the largest, supporting choice B.
- Choice A compares percentage declines in bus ridership: Milltown fell from 120 to 80 (a 40-thousand drop, about 33.3%), Ashbury fell from 150 to 110 (a 40-thousand drop, about 26.7%). Ashbury’s percentage decline is smaller, so A is not supported.
- Choice C: Riverton’s remote work rose by 22 percentage points (8% to 30%), while Glenview’s rose by 17 points (5% to 22%), so they are not equal. C is not supported.
- Choice D claims a universal pattern linking larger remote-work increases to bus ridership decreases. But Riverton and Glenview saw increases in remote work and increases in bus ridership. Thus D is contradicted.</p>

<h2>Question 21:</h2>

<div class="passage">Table 1: Percentage of households with broadband internet access by region (2012, 2016, 2020)
- Urban: 78%, 88%, 93%
- Suburban: 72%, 83%, 90%
- Rural: 55%, 66%, 78%

A newspaper editorial argues that by 2020 the broadband gap between rural and urban households had “nearly closed,” with rural areas “only slightly behind” suburban areas. The editorial also claims that “most of the progress since 2012 has occurred in urban areas.”</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which statement is most strongly supported by the data in Table 1?

A) From 2012 to 2020, urban households experienced the largest increase in broadband access.
B) In 2020, the difference in broadband access between rural and urban households remains at least 15 percentage points.
C) By 2020, suburban households had surpassed urban households in broadband access.
D) The gap between rural and suburban households increased from 2012 to 2020.</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>- To evaluate A, compare increases from 2012 to 2020: Urban rose from 78% to 93% (+15), Suburban from 72% to 90% (+18), Rural from 55% to 78% (+23). Urban did not have the largest increase; rural did. So A is not supported.
- For B, calculate the 2020 rural-urban difference: 93% (urban) − 78% (rural) = 15 percentage points. This matches “at least 15 percentage points,” so B is supported.
- For C, compare 2020 suburban and urban levels: Suburban 90%, Urban 93%. Suburban did not surpass urban. C is not supported.
- For D, compare the rural-suburban gap over time: 2012 difference = 72% − 55% = 17 points; 2020 difference = 90% − 78% = 12 points. The gap decreased, not increased, so D is not supported.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A) From 2012 to 2020, urban households experienced the largest increase in broadband access.
B) In 2020, the difference in broadband access between rural and urban households remains at least 15 percentage points. [Correct]
C) By 2020, suburban households had surpassed urban households in broadband access.
D) The gap between rural and suburban households increased from 2012 to 2020.</p>

<h2>Question 22:</h2>

<div class="text-to-edit">Although the committee had reviewed the proposal thoroughly, however they remained unconvinced, and they requested additional data.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which choice best revises the sentence to correct the structural error and convey the meaning clearly?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>The original sentence improperly combines two contrasting transition structures—“although” (a subordinating conjunction) and “however” (a conjunctive adverb). Using both creates a redundancy and muddles the sentence structure. The best fix is to keep the subordinate structure introduced by “although” and remove “however,” yielding a clear complex sentence. Choice C does this and maintains parallel structure (“remained” and “requested”). Choice B incorrectly uses a semicolon after a dependent clause introduced by “Although,” which is not allowed. Choice D creates a comma splice by placing “however” after a comma (it should follow a semicolon or period) and is awkward. Choice A leaves the error unchanged.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A) NO CHANGE
B) Although the committee had reviewed the proposal thoroughly; they remained unconvinced, and requested additional data.

<h2>Question 23:</h2>

<div class="text-to-edit">Many community gardens rely on volunteers to plant and maintain crops. While watering the beds, pests were seen by Maria. She realized the lettuce had holes and needs a solution.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which choice best combines and revises the second and third sentences to correct errors in sentence structure and maintain clarity and consistent tense?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>The original sentences contain a dangling modifier (“While watering the beds”) because the subject performing the action isn’t immediately and clearly identified, and they also mix tenses (“realized” vs. “needs”) and create ambiguity about who or what needs a solution. The best revision places Maria as the clear subject of the introductory modifier, uses active voice, and maintains parallel and consistent past tense. Correct Answer: C.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A. While watering the beds, pests were seen by Maria, and she realized the lettuce had holes and needs a solution.
B. While Maria watered the beds she was seeing pests, realizing the lettuce had holes and needing a solution for the garden.
C. While Maria was watering the beds, she saw pests and realized that the lettuce had holes and that the garden needed a solution.
D. Pests were seen by Maria while watering the beds, and the holes in the lettuce, she realized, needs a solution.</p>

<h2>Question 24:</h2>

<div class="text-to-edit">The committee reviewed the proposal, discussed its budget implications, and a vote was taken to postpone.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which choice is the best revision of the sentence to maintain parallel structure and use the most effective, concise wording?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>The sentence presents a series of actions performed by the same subject (the committee). To maintain parallel structure, each item in the series should use the same grammatical form. Choice C uses three active verbs—reviewed, discussed, and voted—making the list parallel and concise. Choices A and B shift to passive constructions (“a vote was taken,” “there was a vote”), breaking parallelism and adding wordiness. Choice D mixes verb forms (“reviewed” and “discussing”) and uses an awkward, nonparallel structure.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A. The committee reviewed the proposal, discussed its budget implications, and a vote was taken to postpone.
B. The committee reviewed the proposal, discussed its budget implications, and there was a vote to postpone.
C. The committee reviewed the proposal, discussed its budget implications, and voted to postpone.
D. The committee reviewed the proposal and discussing its budget implications, a vote to postpone was taken.</p>

<h2>Question 25:</h2>

<div class="text-to-edit">To attract visitors, the museum is not only expanding its galleries but also to hire more staff for weekend hours.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which choice best revises the sentence to correct the error in parallel structure while maintaining the intended meaning?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>The correlative pair "not only ... but also" should connect grammatically parallel structures. In the original sentence, "expanding" (a participle used with "is") is paired with "to hire" (an infinitive), which breaks parallelism. The correct revision pairs "expanding" with "hiring." Other options introduce tense or agreement errors or retain the nonparallel form.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>- A. To attract visitors, the museum is not only expanding its galleries but also hiring more staff for weekend hours.
- B. To attract visitors, the museum not only expands its galleries but also hire more staff for weekend hours.
- C. To attract visitors, the museum is not only expanding its galleries but also hires more staff for weekend hours.
- D. To attract visitors, the museum is expanding not only its galleries, but also to hire more staff for weekend hours.</p>

<h2>Question 26:</h2>

<div class="text-to-edit">As a community space, the new library aims to be welcoming to everyone, offering comfortable seating, quiet study rooms, and events that are free to attend. The library’s programming [not only caters to families, but also offering opportunities for teens and seniors.]</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which choice best revises the bracketed portion to create parallel structure and correct punctuation?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>When using the correlative pair “not only … but also,” the grammatical structures that follow should be parallel. In this sentence, “caters” is a finite verb, so the second element should also be a finite verb (“offers”), not a participle (“offering”). Additionally, “not only … but also” does not require a comma when joining two parts of the same clause.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>- A. not only caters to families, but also offering opportunities for teens and seniors.
- B. not only caters to families but also offers opportunities for teens and seniors.
- C. not only catering to families, but also offers opportunities for teens and seniors.
- D. both caters to families, and offers opportunities for teens and seniors.

Correct Answer: B

Why the others are wrong:
- A mixes a finite verb (“caters”) with a participle (“offering”) and unnecessarily inserts a comma.
- C creates nonparallel structure (“catering” vs. “offers”) and misuses the comma.
- D uses “both … and,” which could work, but the comma incorrectly splits a single predicate; the more precise and correctly punctuated parallel is choice B.</p>

<h2>Question 27:</h2>

<div class="text-to-edit">After reviewing the proposals, the decision was made by the committee to postpone the vote until next month.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which choice best revises the sentence to correct the dangling modifier and improve concision while preserving the original meaning?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>The introductory phrase "After reviewing the proposals" should modify the noun that immediately follows it. In the original, it incorrectly modifies "the decision," creating a dangling modifier. Using an active subject (the committee) directly after the introductory phrase fixes the error and is more concise.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A. After reviewing the proposals, the decision was made by the committee to postpone the vote until next month.
B. After reviewing the proposals, the committee decided to postpone the vote until next month.
C. After reviewing the proposals, a decision to postpone the vote until next month was made.

<h2>Question 28:</h2>

<div class="text-to-edit">Many visitors are surprised by the museum's layout, it features a central atrium three satellite galleries and—contrary to tradition—exhibits arranged by theme rather than chronology.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which choice most effectively revises the sentence to correct punctuation errors while maintaining the intended meaning?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>The original sentence contains a comma splice (two independent clauses joined by a comma) and lacks necessary commas in the series. The best correction uses a colon to introduce the explanation of the layout and includes commas to separate items in the list. Choice D does this correctly: it uses a colon after a complete independent clause to introduce an elaboration and places commas between the listed elements while preserving the dash set around the parenthetical phrase. Choice B misuses a semicolon because the clause after it (“featuring a central atrium…”) is not independent. Choice C creates a run-on by failing to punctuate between two independent clauses (“layout it”) and misuses the colon by placing it directly after the verb “features,” which should not be split from its objects. Choice A retains the comma splice and missing commas, so it is incorrect.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A. No change
B. Many visitors are surprised by the museum’s layout; featuring a central atrium, three satellite galleries, and—contrary to tradition—exhibits arranged by theme rather than chronology.
C. Many visitors are surprised by the museum’s layout it features: a central atrium, three satellite galleries, and—contrary to tradition—exhibits arranged by theme rather than chronology.

<h2>Question 29:</h2>

<div class="text-to-edit">The curator faced a dilemma she could delay the opening to add labels or she could proceed, and risk confusing visitors.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which choice best revises the sentence to use punctuation to clearly introduce the alternatives and avoid errors?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>A colon can follow a complete sentence to introduce an explanation or list—in this case, the two alternatives. Each alternative is an independent clause, so a comma before the coordinating conjunction or is appropriate. No comma should separate proceed from the phrase and risk confusing visitors, because that phrase is part of the same predicate and not an independent clause. Options that use a comma between independent clauses (comma splice), misplace a comma within a predicate, or misuse dashes make the sentence less clear.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A. The curator faced a dilemma; she could delay the opening to add labels or she could proceed, and risk confusing visitors.
B. The curator faced a dilemma: she could delay the opening to add labels, or she could proceed and risk confusing visitors.
C. The curator faced a dilemma, she could delay the opening to add labels, or she could proceed and risk confusing visitors.

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which choice best revises the sentence to correctly punctuate the connection between the two independent clauses while maintaining a formal style?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>“However” is a conjunctive adverb linking two independent clauses. To punctuate this correctly, use a semicolon before “however” and a comma after it. This avoids a comma splice and clarifies the transition. 
- Choice A is correct: it uses a semicolon before “however” and a comma after it.
- Choice B creates a comma splice (a comma before “however” is insufficient).
- Choice C omits the comma after “however,” which is needed to set off the conjunctive adverb.
- Choice D uses em dashes, which are more informal and interrupt the flow unnecessarily; they are not the best choice in formal, standard style.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A) The committee released its findings yesterday; however, the summary omitted a key recommendation.
B) The committee released its findings yesterday, however, the summary omitted a key recommendation.

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>- Correct answer: C. This choice eliminates redundancies (“empirically gathered,” “collected,” “clearly demonstrates,” “make plans to,” “move forward in the future”) and states the idea directly and clearly.
- A is wordy and retains unnecessary phrases like “plan to” and “in the future,” which add no meaning.
- B is excessively verbose and includes inflated language (“empirically gathered,” “clearly demonstrates,” “make plans to move forward”) that obscures the point.
- D is awkward and redundant (“that was collected,” “moving forward in the future with implementing”) and less precise.</p>

<h2>Question 34:</h2>

<div class="text-to-edit">(1) In the past decade, urban community gardens have proliferated, transforming vacant lots into productive green spaces. (2) These gardens supply fresh produce to neighborhood residents and provide habitats for pollinators. (3) A 2022 survey of 150 gardens in Chicago found that plots with diverse flowering plants had 30% higher yields. (4) Ancient Egyptians kept bees in clay hives along the Nile, a tradition depicted in temple carvings. (5) However, many neighborhoods lack the resources to start a garden, so city grants and volunteer networks play a crucial role. (6) By coordinating seed donations and training sessions, these groups ensure that new gardens can attract pollinators and thrive.
Note: Sentence 4 is underlined in the original passage.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> To improve logical flow and maintain focus, what should the writer do with sentence 4?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>Choice C is correct because sentence 4 introduces a historical detail about ancient Egypt that does not directly support the paragraph’s focus on modern urban community gardens, their yields, and the resources that help them succeed. Keeping it disrupts the progression from evidence (sentence 3) to challenges and solutions (sentences 5 and 6). Choice A is incorrect: the historical context does not clarify why modern gardens attract pollinators. Choice B is incorrect: the sentence does not bridge the research findings and funding challenges; it sidetracks the discussion. Choice D is incorrect because sentence 3 provides contemporary data, not information similar to ancient beekeeping.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A) Keep sentence 4 because it provides historical context that clarifies why modern gardens attract pollinators.
B) Keep sentence 4 because it gives a compelling example of pollination that bridges research findings and funding challenges.
C) Delete sentence 4 because it is not directly related to urban community gardens and distracts from the paragraph’s main focus on modern practices and support.
D) Delete sentence 4 because similar information is already provided in sentence 3.</p>

<h2>Question 35:</h2>

<div class="text-to-edit">[1] City planners are exploring ways to make rooftops do more than shelter buildings. 
[2] Some propose connecting green roofs to create pollinator corridors across downtown. 
[3] These corridors are networks of habitat patches that allow bees and butterflies to move safely through urban areas. 
[4] Residents have welcomed the idea, citing potential reductions in heat and energy costs. 
[5] Anyone who has visited a city park in summer has seen how flowering plants can attract insects.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> To make the paragraph most logical, where should sentence [5] be placed?
A) Keep it where it is.
B) Before sentence [1].
C) After sentence [3].
D) Delete sentence [5].</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>Sentence [5] provides a concrete example that illustrates the definition in sentence [3]. Placing [5] immediately after [3] logically supports the explanation of pollinator corridors with a familiar example before the paragraph shifts to additional benefits (heat and energy) in sentence [4]. Keeping [5] after [4] (Choice A) disrupts the flow by moving from heat and energy back to insects. Putting [5] before [1] (Choice B) introduces a specific example without context. Deleting [5] (Choice D) removes a helpful illustrative detail that strengthens reader understanding.</p>

<h2>Question 36:</h2>

<div class="text-to-edit">(1) Community gardens are sprouting in vacant lots across the city, providing residents with access to fresh produce. (2) Volunteers organize planting schedules and composting workshops. (3) The soil in vacant lots often contains contaminants from previous industrial use. (4) As a result, the gardens host weekend cooking classes that feature seasonal recipes. (5) To ensure food safety, gardeners first test soil quality and build raised beds filled with clean soil.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> To improve the logical flow of the paragraph, which revision should be made to sentence 4?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>The paragraph first introduces benefits of community gardens (sentences 1–2), then describes a problem (contaminated soil) and a solution (testing soil and building raised beds). Sentence 4 about cooking classes is another benefit, so it belongs with the other positive features near the beginning, not in the middle of the problem–solution section. Additionally, “As a result” incorrectly suggests a cause-and-effect relationship with the preceding sentence. Changing the transition to “In addition,” clarifies that the cooking classes are simply another activity offered by the gardens.

- Choice B is correct because moving sentence 4 to follow sentence 2 groups it with other benefits and changing the transition to “In addition,” makes the relationship additive rather than causal.
- Choice A is not sufficient: even with “In addition,” keeping the sentence after the contamination detail disrupts the problem–solution flow.
- Choice C is illogical: placing the sentence after the solution and keeping “As a result” wrongly suggests the cooking classes result from soil testing and raised beds.
- Choice D removes a relevant detail that enhances the description of garden activities and is unnecessary for coherence when properly placed.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A) Keep sentence 4 where it is but replace “As a result” with “In addition,”
B) Move sentence 4 to follow sentence 2 and change “As a result” to “In addition,”
C) Move sentence 4 to follow sentence 5 and keep “As a result,”
D) Delete sentence 4 entirely</p>

<h2>Question 37:</h2>

<div class="text-to-edit">In the novel, the protagonist confronts her past mistakes with measured resolve. The narrative voice remains restrained, favoring understatement over spectacle. [Sentence to revise:] This part was super cool and totally blew my mind.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which choice best revises the bracketed sentence to maintain the essay’s formal analytical tone and style?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>Correct: B. Option B states the point objectively and analytically, matching the formal tone of the surrounding sentences. Options A and C use slang (“super cool,” “awesome,” “had me like, wow”) and first-person reactions, which are too casual for a formal analysis. Option D is less formal (“neat,” “really”), vague, and still relies on personal reaction rather than precise analysis.</p>

<h2>Question 39:</h2>

<div class="text-to-edit">In an effort to manage stormwater and reduce the urban heat island effect, the city has begun installing green roofs on several public buildings. Preliminary analyses indicate that the initiative will lower cooling costs and improve local water quality. "These roofs are pretty awesome because they soak up rainwater and stop the yucky runoff."

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which choice best replaces the quoted sentence to establish a formal, precise tone consistent with the rest of the paragraph?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>The passage adopts an informative, municipal-report tone. The quoted sentence is too casual and subjective (“pretty awesome,” “yucky”) and uses imprecise language (“soak up rainwater,” “stop”). The best revision should be objective, concise, and use terminology appropriate for environmental policy (e.g., “rainfall,” “stormwater runoff,” “mitigate”). Choice A is both precise and concise, maintaining the formal tone. Choices B and C use colloquial wording and, in C, an inappropriate first-person voice. Choice D is more formal than B and C but is wordier and less direct than A.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> To improve the logical flow and better connect sentence 5 to sentence 4, which choice replaces the beginning of sentence 5 ("For example,") most effectively?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>Sentence 4 announces the city’s plan to expand the program. Sentence 5 provides a benefit of composting that could motivate expansion. The best transition explicitly links that benefit to the decision described in sentence 4. Choice D, “One reason for this expansion is that,” clearly ties the benefit (turning scraps into soil) to the expansion, strengthening coherence. Choice A (“For example,”) suggests sentence 5 is merely an example of the preceding sentence, but the preceding sentence states a plan, not a general claim that needs an example; the link is weak. Choice B (“However,”) signals contrast, which is inappropriate because sentence 5 does not contradict sentence 4. Choice C (“In addition,”) adds information but does not clarify the relationship between the benefit and the expansion, resulting in a looser connection than D.</p>

<p>The paragraph introduces the composting program (sentence 1), describes how it was implemented (sentence 2), and then presents a result (sentence 3) followed by an additional outcome (sentence 5). The definition in sentence (4) explains what compost is and why it’s beneficial; placing it early, right after the program is introduced, helps readers understand the context before the implementation details and results. Putting sentence (4) after sentence (1) creates a logical progression from introduction to explanation to actions and outcomes.

D) The sentence should be deleted</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>Correct Answer: A
- A) After sentence [3] is best because placing the historical example directly before sentence [4] gives the transitional word “Similarly” a clear antecedent. The comparison then flows logically: past botanists cataloging herbs parallels modern coordinators tracking garden data.
- B) After sentence [6] disrupts the cause-and-effect conclusion (“As a result…”) and leaves “Similarly” in sentence [4] without a prior example to echo.
- C) Before sentence [1] opens the paragraph with distant historical context, weakening focus on the modern topic and placing the example too far from the transition that references it.
- D) Deleting sentence [5] removes the comparative anchor for “Similarly,” leaving the transition unsupported and reducing cohesion. If sentence [5] were deleted, sentence [4] would need a different transition (e.g., “For instance”) to maintain clarity.</p>

<h2>Question 43:</h2>

<p>A line L passes through the point (3, −2) and is perpendicular to the line 4x − 3y = 12. Line L intersects the line y = 2x + k at an x-coordinate of 5. What is the value of k?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>- First find the slope of 4x − 3y = 12. Rewrite as y = (4/3)x − 4, so its slope is 4/3. A line perpendicular to this has slope −3/4.
- Using slope −3/4 and the point (3, −2), the equation of L is y + 2 = (−3/4)(x − 3). Simplify: y = (−3/4)x + 9/4 − 2 = (−3/4)x + 1/4.
- At x = 5, the y-value on L is y = (−3/4)(5) + 1/4 = −15/4 + 1/4 = −14/4 = −7/2.
- At the intersection with y = 2x + k when x = 5, the y-value is 10 + k. Set equal: 10 + k = −7/2, so k = −7/2 − 10 = −27/2.</p>

<h2>Question 44:</h2>

<p>Two lines L1 and L2 are given by y = ax + b and y = (a + 1)x + (b − 3). If both lines pass through the point (3, 7) and the distance between their x-intercepts is 7/2, what is the sum of all possible values of b?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>Since both lines pass through (3, 7), substitute x = 3 and y = 7 into each:
For L1: 7 = 3a + b ⇒ b = 7 − 3a.

The x-intercept of a line y = mx + c is found by setting y = 0: x = −c/m.
Thus,
- x-intercept of L1: x1 = −b/a = −(7 − 3a)/a = −7/a + 3.
- x-intercept of L2: x2 = −(b − 3)/(a + 1) = −((7 − 3a) − 3)/(a + 1) = −(4 − 3a)/(a + 1) = 3 − 7/(a + 1).

The distance between x-intercepts is |x1 − x2|:
|x1 − x2| = |(−7/a + 3) − (3 − 7/(a + 1))| = |−7/a + 7/(a + 1)| = 7 · |−1/a + 1/(a + 1)|.

Compute inside the absolute value:
−1/a + 1/(a + 1) = [−(a + 1) + a] / [a(a + 1)] = −1 / [a(a + 1)].

So the distance becomes 7 · |−1 / [a(a + 1)]| = 7 / |a(a + 1)|.
Given that this equals 7/2, we have:
7 / |a(a + 1)| = 7/2 ⇒ |a(a + 1)| = 2.

Solve |a(a + 1)| = 2:
- Case 1: a(a + 1) = 2 ⇒ a^2 + a − 2 = 0 ⇒ (a − 1)(a + 2) = 0 ⇒ a = 1 or a = −2.
- Case 2: a(a + 1) = −2 ⇒ a^2 + a + 2 = 0 (no real solutions).

Thus a = 1 or a = −2. Using b = 7 − 3a:
- If a = 1, then b = 7 − 3(1) = 4.
- If a = −2, then b = 7 − 3(−2) = 13.

Sum of possible b values: 4 + 13 = 17.</p>

<h2>Question 45:</h2>

<p>For what value of k does the system of linear equations
2x + k y = 7
4x + 2y = 13
have no solution?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>A system of two linear equations has no solution when the two lines are parallel but not the same line. That happens when the ratios of the coefficients of x and y are equal (same slope), but the ratio of the constants is different (different intercept).

Compare ratios:
- Coefficients of x: 2 and 4, so 2/4 = 1/2.
- Coefficients of y: k and 2, so k/2 must equal 1/2 for parallel lines. This gives k = 1.
- Constants: 7 and 13, with ratio 7/13. Since 7/13 ≠ 1/2, the lines are not the same, so they are distinct and parallel.

Therefore, the system has no solution when k = 1.</p>

<h2>Question 46:</h2>

<p>Which of the following represents the solution set to the inequality |x − 4| + |2x + 1| ≤ 7 ?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>The expressions inside the absolute values change sign at x = 4 and x = −1/2. Solve by cases based on these critical points.

- Case 1: x ≤ −1/2
  Here, |x − 4| = 4 − x and |2x + 1| = −(2x + 1). The inequality becomes:
  (4 − x) + (−2x − 1) ≤ 7 → 3 − 3x ≤ 7 → −3x ≤ 4 → x ≥ −4/3.
  Combined with x ≤ −1/2, this gives −4/3 ≤ x ≤ −1/2.

- Case 2: −1/2 ≤ x ≤ 4
  Here, |x − 4| = 4 − x and |2x + 1| = 2x + 1. The inequality becomes:
  (4 − x) + (2x + 1) ≤ 7 → 5 + x ≤ 7 → x ≤ 2.
  Combined with −1/2 ≤ x ≤ 4, this gives −1/2 ≤ x ≤ 2.

- Case 3: x ≥ 4
  Here, |x − 4| = x − 4 and |2x + 1| = 2x + 1. The inequality becomes:
  (x − 4) + (2x + 1) ≤ 7 → 3x − 3 ≤ 7 → 3x ≤ 10 → x ≤ 10/3.
  Combined with x ≥ 4, there is no solution in this case.

Combining the solutions from the first two cases gives the final solution set: [−4/3, 2].</p>

<h2>Question 47:</h2>

<p>For all real points (x, y) satisfying |x − 2| + |y − 1| ≤ 3, what is the maximum possible value of 3x + y?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>The inequality |x − 2| + |y − 1| ≤ 3 describes a diamond-shaped (rhombus) region centered at (2, 1) with “radius” 3 in L1 (Manhattan) distance. Equivalently, let Δx = x − 2 and Δy = y − 1; then |Δx| + |Δy| ≤ 3 and we want to maximize 3x + y = 3(2 + Δx) + (1 + Δy) = 7 + (3Δx + Δy).

So the problem reduces to maximizing 3Δx + Δy subject to |Δx| + |Δy| ≤ 3. Because the weights are 3 on Δx and 1 on Δy, we should allocate the entire “budget” of 3 to Δx to maximize the expression. Set Δx = 3 and Δy = 0 (which satisfies |Δx| + |Δy| = 3). Then:
- 3Δx + Δy = 3(3) + 0 = 9
- 3x + y = 7 + 9 = 16

Checking the vertices of the diamond confirms this: the vertices are (5, 1), (−1, 1), (2, 4), and (2, −2). Evaluating 3x + y at these gives 16, −2, 10, and 4, respectively, so the maximum is 16 at (5, 1).</p>

<h2>Question 48:</h2>

<p>If |(x − 1)/(x + 3)| < 1/2, how many integer values of x satisfy the inequality?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>- The expression is undefined at x = −3, so x ≠ −3.
- Multiply both sides by |x + 3| (positive for all x ≠ −3) to get |x − 1| < (1/2)|x + 3|.
- Multiply both sides by 2 (a positive constant): 2|x − 1| < |x + 3|.
- Square both sides (valid because both sides are nonnegative): 4(x − 1)^2 < (x + 3)^2.
- Expand: 4x^2 − 8x + 4 < x^2 + 6x + 9 → 3x^2 − 14x − 5 < 0.
- Factor: (3x + 1)(x − 5) < 0. The roots are x = −1/3 and x = 5. Since the quadratic opens upward, the solution set is −1/3 < x < 5.
- Integers in this interval are x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Note x = −3 is not in the interval, so no domain conflict.
- Thus, there are 5 integer solutions.</p>

<h2>Question 49:</h2>

<p>Consider the system of equations x + my = 10 and mx + y = 6, where m is a nonzero real number. If the system has exactly one solution and both x and y are integers, what is the sum of all possible values of m?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>The system has a unique solution when the determinant 1 − m^2 ≠ 0, so m ≠ ±1 (and m ≠ 0 by the problem statement).

Add and subtract the equations:
- Adding: (x + my) + (mx + y) = 16 ⇒ (1 + m)(x + y) = 16 ⇒ x + y = 16/(1 + m).
- Subtracting: (x + my) − (mx + y) = 4 ⇒ (1 − m)(x − y) = 4 ⇒ x − y = 4/(1 − m).

Let A = x + y and B = x − y. If x and y are integers, then A and B are integers and must have the same parity (so that x = (A + B)/2 and y = (A − B)/2 are integers). Also,
m = 16/A − 1 and m = 1 − 4/B.
Equating these gives 16/A − 1 = 1 − 4/B ⇒ B(A − 8) = 2A.

Let d = A − 8. Then d must divide 16 (since B = 2 + 16/d must be integer), so d ∈ {±1, ±2, ±4, ±8, ±16}, giving A ∈ {9, 7, 10, 6, 12, 4, 16, 0, 24, −8}. For each A, compute B = 2 + 16/d and check parity:

- A = 10, B = 10 ⇒ both even ⇒ m = 16/10 − 1 = 3/5.
- A = 6, B = −6 ⇒ both even ⇒ m = 16/6 − 1 = 5/3.
- A = 12, B = 6 ⇒ both even ⇒ m = 16/12 − 1 = 1/3.
- A = 4, B = −2 ⇒ both even ⇒ m = 16/4 − 1 = 3.

Other A values yield A and B of opposite parity or m = 0 or undefined, so they are invalid. All four valid m are not ±1, and each produces integer (x, y):
- m = 3/5 ⇒ (x, y) = (10, 0)
- m = 5/3 ⇒ (x, y) = (0, 6)
- m = 1/3 ⇒ (x, y) = (9, 3)
- m = 3 ⇒ (x, y) = (1, 3)

<p>Let x and y be real numbers satisfying the system:
3x + 2y = 14
x^2 − y^2 = 32
Find all possible values of x − y.</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>- Recognize that x^2 − y^2 factors as (x − y)(x + y). Let s = x + y and d = x − y. Then s·d = 32.
- Express the linear equation in terms of s and d:
  3x + 2y = 3((s + d)/2) + 2((s − d)/2) = (5s + d)/2 = 14, so 5s + d = 28.
- Solve the system:
  d = 28 − 5s, and s·d = 32 ⇒ s(28 − 5s) = 32 ⇒ 28s − 5s^2 = 32 ⇒ 5s^2 − 28s + 32 = 0.
- Solve the quadratic: Discriminant = 28^2 − 4·5·32 = 784 − 640 = 144, so s = [28 ± 12]/10 ⇒ s = 4 or s = 8/5.
- Find d from d = 28 − 5s:
  If s = 4, then d = 28 − 20 = 8.
  If s = 8/5, then d = 28 − 8 = 20.

Therefore, the possible values of x − y are 8 and 20.</p>

<h2>Question 51:</h2>

<p>The system of equations x + y = t and 2x − 5y = 13 has solutions (x, y). For how many integer values of t with 0 ≤ t ≤ 100 are both x and y integers?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>Solve the system for y in terms of t:
From x + y = t, multiply by 2: 2x + 2y = 2t.
Subtract 2x − 5y = 13 from this: (2x + 2y) − (2x − 5y) = 2t − 13, giving 7y = 2t − 13, so y = (2t − 13)/7.

For y to be an integer, 2t − 13 must be divisible by 7. This means 2t ≡ 13 (mod 7), i.e., 2t ≡ 6 (mod 7). The inverse of 2 modulo 7 is 4 (since 2·4 ≡ 1 mod 7), so t ≡ 4·6 ≡ 24 ≡ 3 (mod 7).

Now check x: x = t − y = t − (2t − 13)/7 = (5t + 13)/7. If t ≡ 3 (mod 7), then 5t + 13 ≡ 5·3 + 13 = 28 ≡ 0 (mod 7), so x is also an integer.

Thus, t must be congruent to 3 modulo 7. The integers t in [0, 100] with t ≡ 3 (mod 7) are 3, 10, 17, 24, 31, 38, 45, 52, 59, 66, 73, 80, 87, 94. There are 14 such values.</p>

<h2>Question 52:</h2>

<p>How many integer values of k make the equation x^2 + (k − 2)x + (46 − k) = 0 have two distinct integer solutions?

A) 3
B) 4
C) 6
D) 8</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>- For a quadratic ax^2 + bx + c to have two distinct real roots, its discriminant must be positive: D = b^2 − 4ac > 0.
- Here, a = 1, b = k − 2, c = 46 − k, so
  D = (k − 2)^2 − 4(46 − k) = k^2 − 180.
- To get integer roots, we want D to be a perfect square (so the roots are rational), and since the leading coefficient is 1, any rational roots are integers (by the rational root theorem). Thus we need k^2 − 180 = s^2 for some integer s, with s ≠ 0 (to ensure distinct roots).
- Rewrite as a difference of squares: k^2 − s^2 = 180 ⇒ (k − s)(k + s) = 180.
- Let a = k − s and b = k + s, so ab = 180 and k = (a + b)/2. For k to be an integer, a and b must have the same parity. Since 180 is even, both must be even. Write a = 2u and b = 2v, giving (2u)(2v) = 180 ⇒ uv = 45.
- The factor pairs of 45 (including negatives) are:
  Positive: (1, 45), (3, 15), (5, 9)
  Negative: (−1, −45), (−3, −15), (−5, −9)
- Each pair (u, v) yields k = u + v:
  1 + 45 = 46, 3 + 15 = 18, 5 + 9 = 14
  −1 + (−45) = −46, −3 + (−15) = −18, −5 + (−9) = −14
- These 6 k-values make D a positive perfect square, producing two distinct integer roots.</p>

<h2>Question 53:</h2>

<p>Let k be an integer such that the quadratic equation x^2 − kx + 2k = 0 has both solutions as integers. What is the sum of all possible values of k?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>If the roots are integers r and s, then by Vieta’s formulas:
- r + s = k
- rs = 2k

Substitute k = r + s into rs = 2k to get:
rs = 2(r + s)
rs − 2r − 2s = 0
Add 4 to both sides to factor:
(rs − 2r − 2s + 4) = 4
(r − 2)(s − 2) = 4

Now list integer factor pairs of 4 and convert back to r and s:
- 1 and 4 → r = 3, s = 6 → k = r + s = 9
- 2 and 2 → r = 4, s = 4 → k = 8
- −1 and −4 → r = 1, s = −2 → k = −1
- −2 and −2 → r = 0, s = 0 → k = 0
(The swapped pairs 4 and 1, −4 and −1 give the same k values.)

Distinct k values are {9, 8, −1, 0}. Their sum is 9 + 8 + (−1) + 0 = 16.</p>

<h2>Question 54:</h2>

<p>If the quadratic equation x^2 + px + q = 0 has roots that are consecutive integers, what is the value of p^2 − 4q?
A) 0
B) 1
C) 2
D) 4</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>Let the roots be n and n + 1 for some integer n.
- Sum of roots = n + (n + 1) = 2n + 1 = −p, so p = −(2n + 1).
- Product of roots = n(n + 1) = n^2 + n = q.

Compute p^2 − 4q:
p^2 − 4q = [−(2n + 1)]^2 − 4(n^2 + n)
= (4n^2 + 4n + 1) − (4n^2 + 4n)
= 1.

Therefore, p^2 − 4q = 1.</p>

<h2>Question 55:</h2>

<p>Let P(x) be a cubic polynomial with leading coefficient 2. If P(1) = 1, P(2) = 2, and P(3) = 3, what is P(0)?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>By the Remainder (Evaluation) Theorem, the given conditions mean P(1) = 1, P(2) = 2, and P(3) = 3. Define Q(x) = P(x) − x. Then Q(1) = Q(2) = Q(3) = 0, so Q(x) has roots 1, 2, and 3. Since P is cubic with leading coefficient 2, Q is also cubic with leading coefficient 2 (subtracting x does not change the cubic term). Therefore,
Q(x) = 2(x − 1)(x − 2)(x − 3).
Hence,
P(0) = Q(0) + 0 = 2(−1)(−2)(−3) = 2(−6) = −12.</p>

<h2>Question 56:</h2>

<p>Let P(x) be a monic cubic polynomial. When P(x) is divided by x − 1, x + 2, and x − 3, the remainders are 2, −7, and 5, respectively. What is P(0)?
A) 11/2
B) 28/5
C) 3
D) 7/2
E) 5</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>By the Remainder Theorem, dividing by x − a leaves remainder P(a). So:
- P(1) = 2
- P(−2) = −7
- P(3) = 5

Let P(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c (monic cubic). Then:
1) P(1) = 1 + a + b + c = 2  → a + b + c = 1
2) P(−2) = −8 + 4a − 2b + c = −7 → 4a − 2b + c = 1
3) P(3) = 27 + 9a + 3b + c = 5 → 9a + 3b + c = −22

Subtract (1) from (2): (4a − 2b + c) − (a + b + c) = 1 − 1 → 3a − 3b = 0 → a = b.
Subtract (1) from (3): (9a + 3b + c) − (a + b + c) = −22 − 1 → 8a + 2b = −23. With a = b, 10a = −23 → a = b = −23/10.

From (1): a + b + c = 1 → −23/10 − 23/10 + c = 1 → c = 28/5.

Therefore, P(0) = c = 28/5.</p>

<h2>Question 57:</h2>

<p>Let P(x) be a cubic polynomial with real coefficients and leading coefficient 2 such that P(x) + 3x − 5 is divisible by (x − 1)(x + 2). If P(0) = 7, what is P(3)?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>Since (x − 1)(x + 2) divides P(x) + 3x − 5, we have:
- P(1) + 3(1) − 5 = 0 ⇒ P(1) = 2
- P(−2) + 3(−2) − 5 = 0 ⇒ P(−2) = 11

Let Q(x) be the quotient when P(x) + 3x − 5 is divided by (x − 1)(x + 2). Because P(x) is cubic with leading coefficient 2 and (x − 1)(x + 2) is quadratic, Q(x) must be linear with leading coefficient 2. So write Q(x) = 2x + b.

Then P(x) = (x − 1)(x + 2)(2x + b) − (3x − 5).

Use P(0) = 7 to find b:
P(0) = (−1)(2)(b) − (0 − 5) = −2b + 5 = 7 ⇒ b = −1.

Now compute P(3):
(x − 1)(x + 2) at x = 3 is 2 · 5 = 10,
(2x + b) at x = 3 is 6 − 1 = 5,
so (x − 1)(x + 2)(2x + b) at x = 3 is 10 · 5 = 50,
and 3x − 5 at x = 3 is 9 − 5 = 4.
Therefore, P(3) = 50 − 4 = 46.</p>

<h2>Question 58:</h2>

<p>For real parameter a, consider the rational equation
x/(x − a) + a/(x − 2) = 1,
where x ≠ a and x ≠ 2. Which statement about the number of real solutions in x is true?
A) Exactly one solution for every real a.
B) Exactly one solution for every real a ≠ 2.
C) Exactly one solution for every real a except a = 0 and a = 2; infinitely many solutions when a = 0; no solution when a = 2.
D) No real solutions for any a.</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>- Domain restrictions: x ≠ a and x ≠ 2.
- For a ≠ 0, multiply both sides by (x − a)(x − 2):
  x(x − 2) + a(x − a) = (x − a)(x − 2).
  Expand: x^2 − 2x + ax − a^2 = x^2 − (a + 2)x + 2a.
  Simplify: (a − 2)x − a^2 = −(a + 2)x + 2a.
  Bringing all to one side yields 2a x − a(a + 2) = 0, so if a ≠ 0,
  x = (a + 2)/2.
  Check domain exclusions for this x:
  - x ≠ a ⇒ (a + 2)/2 ≠ a ⇒ a ≠ 2.
  - x ≠ 2 ⇒ (a + 2)/2 ≠ 2 ⇒ a ≠ 2.
  Therefore, for a ≠ 0 and a ≠ 2, there is exactly one valid solution x = (a + 2)/2.
- Special cases:
  - a = 0: The equation becomes x/x + 0/(x − 2) = 1 ⇒ 1 = 1, which is true for all x in the domain (x ≠ 0 and x ≠ 2). Hence infinitely many solutions.
  - a = 2: The equation becomes (x + 2)/(x − 2) = 1 ⇒ x + 2 = x − 2, contradiction. Hence no solution.</p>

<h2>Question 59:</h2>

<p>For all real x for which the expressions are defined, the identity
(px^2 + ax + b)/(x^2 − 4) − (3x − 1)/(x + 2) = 2/(x − 2)
holds. What is the ordered triple (p, a, b)?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>- Note that x^2 − 4 factors as (x − 2)(x + 2), so the common denominator is (x − 2)(x + 2). The identity must hold for all x ≠ ±2.
- Rewrite each term over the common denominator:
  (px^2 + ax + b)/[(x − 2)(x + 2)] − (3x − 1)(x − 2)/[(x − 2)(x + 2)] = 2(x + 2)/[(x − 2)(x + 2)].
- Therefore the numerators must be equal:
  (px^2 + ax + b) − (3x − 1)(x − 2) = 2(x + 2).
- Expand (3x − 1)(x − 2) = 3x^2 − 7x + 2, so the left numerator is:
  px^2 + ax + b − (3x^2 − 7x + 2) = (p − 3)x^2 + (a + 7)x + (b − 2).
- Match coefficients with the right numerator 2x + 4:
  For x^2: p − 3 = 0 → p = 3.
  For x: a + 7 = 2 → a = −5.
  Constant: b − 2 = 4 → b = 6.
- Thus (p, a, b) = (3, −5, 6).</p>

<h2>Question 60:</h2>

<p>For how many integer values of p between −10 and 10 inclusive does the equation (x^2 − 1)/(x − p) = x + 1 have exactly one real solution?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>- The equation is undefined at x = p, so any solution must satisfy x ≠ p.
- Multiply both sides by (x − p) (valid for x ≠ p):
  x^2 − 1 = (x + 1)(x − p) = x^2 + (1 − p)x − p.
  Subtract x^2 from both sides:
  −1 = (1 − p)x − p.
  If p ≠ 1, then 1 − p ≠ 0 and we can solve for x:
  x = (p − 1)/(1 − p) = −1.
- Check the solution against the domain restriction x ≠ p:
  - If p ≠ −1 and p ≠ 1, then x = −1 is allowed and is the only solution, so there is exactly one real solution.
  - Special case p = −1: the only candidate x = −1 is not allowed (it would make the denominator zero), so there are no solutions.
  - Special case p = 1: The original equation becomes (x^2 − 1)/(x − 1) = x + 1. For x ≠ 1, the left side simplifies to x + 1, so the equation is an identity with infinitely many solutions (all real x ≠ 1), not exactly one.
- Therefore, among the integers from −10 to 10 (a total of 21 integers), exclude p = −1 and p = 1. That leaves 21 − 2 = 19 values of p that yield exactly one real solution.</p>

<h2>Question 61:</h2>

<p>For x > 0, if √x + 1/√x = 3, what is x^(3/2) + x^(-3/2)?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>Let a = √x and b = 1/√x. Then a + b = 3 and ab = 1.
We want a^3 + b^3, because a^3 = x^(3/2) and b^3 = x^(-3/2).

Use the identity (a + b)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + 3ab(a + b).
So a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3 − 3ab(a + b) = 3^3 − 3·1·3 = 27 − 9 = 18.

Therefore, x^(3/2) + x^(-3/2) = 18.</p>

<h2>Question 62:</h2>

<p>For x > 0 and x ≠ 1, solve the equation (x^(3/4) − x^(1/4)) / (√x − 1) = 2.</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>Let t = x^(1/4). Then √x = x^(1/2) = t^2.
Rewrite the numerator and denominator in terms of t:
- Numerator: x^(3/4) − x^(1/4) = t^3 − t = t(t^2 − 1) = t(t − 1)(t + 1).
- Denominator: √x − 1 = t^2 − 1 = (t − 1)(t + 1).

The fraction becomes:
[t(t − 1)(t + 1)] / [(t − 1)(t + 1)] = t.

So the equation simplifies to t = 2. Since t = x^(1/4), we have x^(1/4) = 2, which gives x = 2^4 = 16.
This satisfies the domain (x > 0 and x ≠ 1), and the original denominator is nonzero.</p>

<h2>Question 63:</h2>

<p>Solve for real x: sqrt(16^x + 9) = 2^x + 3.</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>Let t = 2^x, so t > 0. Notice that 16^x = (2^4)^x = 2^{4x} = (2^x)^4 = t^4. The equation becomes sqrt(t^4 + 9) = t + 3. Since both sides are nonnegative for t > 0, we can square both sides:
t^4 + 9 = (t + 3)^2 = t^2 + 6t + 9.
Rearrange:
t^4 - t^2 - 6t = 0
t(t^3 - t - 6) = 0.
Because t = 2^x > 0, t ≠ 0, so we solve t^3 - t - 6 = 0. Test simple integer roots: t = 2 gives 8 - 2 - 6 = 0, so t = 2 is a root. Factor:
(t - 2)(t^2 + 2t + 3) = 0.
The quadratic t^2 + 2t + 3 has no real roots (discriminant 4 - 12 = -8), so the only real solution is t = 2. Thus 2^x = 2, giving x = 1. Check in the original equation: sqrt(16^1 + 9) = sqrt(25) = 5, and 2^1 + 3 = 5. The solution checks out.</p>

<h2>Question 64:</h2>

<p>A jar contains blue and red beads in the ratio 7:3. An equal number of blue and red beads are added, and the new ratio becomes 13:7. Then 20 red beads are removed, resulting in a ratio of 2:1. How many beads were originally in the jar?
A) 500
B) 540
C) 600
D) 660</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>Let the original numbers of blue and red beads be 7k and 3k, respectively, so the original total is 10k.
Suppose x blue and x red beads are added. Then the new counts are 7k + x (blue) and 3k + x (red), and we are told:
(7k + x) / (3k + x) = 13 / 7
Cross-multiply: 7(7k + x) = 13(3k + x) → 49k + 7x = 39k + 13x → 10k = 6x → x = (5/3)k.

Next, 20 red beads are removed. The counts become 7k + x (blue) and 3k + x − 20 (red), and the ratio is now 2:1:
(7k + x) / (3k + x − 20) = 2 / 1
Cross-multiply: 7k + x = 2(3k + x − 20) → 7k + x = 6k + 2x − 40 → k = x − 40 → x = k + 40.

Equate the two expressions for x:
(5/3)k = k + 40 → (5/3 − 1)k = 40 → (2/3)k = 40 → k = 60.
Original total = 10k = 10 × 60 = 600.</p>

<h2>Question 65:</h2>

<p>A tank contains a mixture of water and juice in the ratio 4:1 by volume. First, 20% of the mixture is drained and replaced with pure juice. Next, 25% of the new mixture is drained and replaced with pure water. What is the final ratio of water to juice in the tank?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>Let the total volume be T.
Initially: water = (4/5)T, juice = (1/5)T.

Step 1: Remove 20% = (1/5)T of the mixture, which has the same proportions.
- Water removed: (4/5)T × (1/5) = (4/25)T
- Juice removed: (1/5)T × (1/5) = (1/25)T
Left after removal:
- Water: (4/5)T − (4/25)T = (20/25 − 4/25)T = (16/25)T
- Juice: (1/5)T − (1/25)T = (5/25 − 1/25)T = (4/25)T
Replace with pure juice amount (1/5)T = (5/25)T:
- Water stays (16/25)T
- Juice becomes (4/25 + 5/25)T = (9/25)T
Ratio after Step 1: water:juice = 16:9.

Step 2: Remove 25% = (1/4)T of the mixture, which currently has water fraction 16/25 and juice fraction 9/25.
- Water removed: (16/25) × (1/4)T = (16/100)T = (4/25)T
- Juice removed: (9/25) × (1/4)T = (9/100)T
Left after removal:
- Water: (16/25 − 4/25)T = (12/25)T = (48/100)T
- Juice: (9/25 − 9/100)T = (36/100 − 9/100)T = (27/100)T
Replace with pure water amount (1/4)T = (25/100)T:
- Water: (48/100 + 25/100)T = (73/100)T
- Juice: (27/100)T
Final ratio of water to juice = 73:27.</p>

<h2>Question 66:</h2>

<p>A 80-liter mixture contains liquids A and B in the ratio 3:5. An amount of the mixture is drained and replaced with the same amount of pure liquid A. After this single drain-and-replace step, the ratio of A to B becomes 1:1. What percent of the original mixture was replaced?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>Let x be the number of liters drained (and then replaced with pure A).
- Initially: A = 3/8 of 80 = 30 L, B = 5/8 of 80 = 50 L.
- Draining x liters removes A and B in the same 3:5 ratio:
  A removed = (3/8)x, B removed = (5/8)x.
- After draining and adding back x liters of pure A:
  New A = 30 − (3/8)x + x = 30 + (5/8)x
  New B = 50 − (5/8)x
The ratio becomes 1:1, so set A = B:
30 + (5/8)x = 50 − (5/8)x
(10/8)x = 20 → (5/4)x = 20 → x = 16.

<h2>Question 69:</h2>

<p>A store advertises “25% off, then an additional 20% off the discounted price.” An item’s final price before sales tax is $270. The cashier mistakenly calculates sales tax on the original retail price rather than on the discounted price, and the customer pays $54 more than they should have because of this mistake. What is the sales tax rate?

A) 12%
B) 15%
C) 20%
D) 30%
E) 35%</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>- Let R be the original retail price. After two successive discounts, the pre-tax price is R × 0.75 × 0.80 = R × 0.60. We are given R × 0.60 = 270, so R = 270 ÷ 0.60 = 450.
- Let r be the sales tax rate (as a decimal). The correct tax should be r × 270. The mistaken tax was r × 450.
- The overcharge is the difference: r × 450 − r × 270 = r × 180.
- We are told this overcharge equals $54, so r × 180 = 54 ⇒ r = 54 ÷ 180 = 0.30 = 30%.</p>

<h2>Question 70:</h2>

<p>At a high school, some students are seniors and the rest are underclassmen. Of the seniors, 70% are enrolled in a statistics course, and of the underclassmen, 40% are enrolled in a statistics course. Overall, 49% of all students are enrolled in a statistics course. If a randomly selected student is enrolled in a statistics course, what is the probability that the student is a senior?

A) 2/5
B) 3/7
C) 1/2
D) 4/7
E) 3/5</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>Let s be the proportion of students who are seniors. By the law of total probability for being enrolled in statistics:
0.49 = 0.7s + 0.4(1 − s)
0.49 = 0.7s + 0.4 − 0.4s
0.49 = 0.4 + 0.3s
0.09 = 0.3s
s = 0.3

We want P(Senior | Statistics). Using Bayes’ rule:
P(Senior | Statistics) = [P(Statistics | Senior) · P(Senior)] / P(Statistics)
= (0.7 · 0.3) / 0.49
= 0.21 / 0.49
= 21/49 = 3/7</p>

<h2>Question 71:</h2>

<p>A jar contains 7 white, 5 black, and 4 orange marbles. Two marbles are drawn at random without replacement. Given that at least one of the marbles drawn is orange, what is the probability that the first marble drawn is orange?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>Let A be the event “the first marble drawn is orange” and B be the event “at least one of the two marbles drawn is orange.”
We want P(A | B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). Since A implies B (if the first is orange, then at least one is orange), P(A ∩ B) = P(A).

- Compute P(A): There are 4 orange marbles out of 16 total marbles.
  P(A) = 4/16 = 1/4.

- Compute P(B): It is easier to find the complement, “no orange in two draws,” then subtract from 1.
  Non-orange marbles = 7 + 5 = 12.
  P(no orange) = (12/16) × (11/15) = 132/240 = 11/20.
  Therefore, P(B) = 1 − 11/20 = 9/20.

Now,
P(A | B) = (1/4) ÷ (9/20) = (1/4) × (20/9) = 5/9.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A) 1/4
B) 9/20
C) 4/9

<h2>Question 72:</h2>

<p>At a clinic, 60% of patients are new and 40% are returning. A screening test yields a positive result for 12% of new patients and 30% of returning patients. Only patients who test positive take a follow-up test, which confirms the condition for 80% of new positives and 90% of returning positives. If a randomly selected patient is confirmed by the follow-up test, what is the probability that the patient is a returning patient?

A) 3/5
B) 15/23
C) 9/23
D) 27/41
E) 9/20</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>Let N be “new patient,” R be “returning patient,” and C be “confirmed by follow-up.”

Compute the probability of being confirmed from each group:
- For new patients: P(C ∩ N) = P(N) × P(positive | N) × P(confirmed | positive, N)
= 0.60 × 0.12 × 0.80 = 0.0576.
- For returning patients: P(C ∩ R) = P(R) × P(positive | R) × P(confirmed | positive, R)
= 0.40 × 0.30 × 0.90 = 0.108.

Total probability of being confirmed:
P(C) = P(C ∩ N) + P(C ∩ R) = 0.0576 + 0.108 = 0.1656.

Use conditional probability:
P(R | C) = P(C ∩ R) / P(C) = 0.108 / 0.1656.

Convert to an exact fraction:
0.108/0.1656 = (27/250) / (414/2500) = 270/414 = 135/207 = 15/23.</p>

<h2>Question 73:</h2>

<p>Based on the speed–time graph described, what is the total distance, in miles, that the car travels during the 20-minute interval?

A) 6.50
B) 7.08
C) 8.00
D) 9.50</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>Distance traveled equals the area under the speed–time graph. Because speed is in miles per hour and time is in minutes, convert minutes to hours when computing areas.

Break the graph into four segments:

1) t = 0 to 5: Speed increases linearly from 0 to 30 mph.
- Area is a triangle with base 5 minutes and height 30 mph.
- Convert base to hours: 5 minutes = 5/60 hours.
- Distance = (1/2) × (5/60) × 30 = (1/2) × (150/60) = (1/2) × 2.5 = 1.25 miles.

2) t = 5 to 12: Speed is constant at 30 mph.
- Time = 7 minutes = 7/60 hours.
- Distance = 30 × (7/60) = 210/60 = 3.5 miles.

3) t = 12 to 16: Speed decreases linearly from 30 to 10 mph.
- Over 4 minutes = 4/60 hours, the average speed is (30 + 10)/2 = 20 mph.
- Distance = 20 × (4/60) = 80/60 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333... miles.

4) t = 16 to 20: Speed increases linearly from 10 to 20 mph.
- Over 4 minutes = 4/60 hours, the average speed is (10 + 20)/2 = 15 mph.
- Distance = 15 × (4/60) = 60/60 = 1 mile.

Total distance = 1.25 + 3.5 + 1.333... + 1 = 7.0833... miles = 85/12 miles ≈ 7.08 miles.

Therefore, the correct choice is 7.08.</p>

<h2>Question 74:</h2>

<p>Based on the graph, at approximately what time t (in hours) does the hiker’s total distance traveled first reach 24 miles?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>- The area under a speed-time graph equals distance traveled.
- Compute cumulative distance up to the key breakpoints:
  - From t = 0 to 2: triangle with base 2 and height 4 ⇒ distance = (1/2) × 2 × 4 = 4 miles.
  - From t = 2 to 5: rectangle with width 3 and height 4 ⇒ distance = 3 × 4 = 12 miles.
    - Cumulative at t = 5: 4 + 12 = 16 miles.
  - From t = 5 to 6: trapezoid with bases 4 and 2 over 1 hour ⇒ average speed = (4 + 2)/2 = 3 ⇒ distance = 3 miles.
    - Cumulative at t = 6: 16 + 3 = 19 miles.
- We need 24 miles total, so 5 more miles after t = 6. On [6, 8], speed increases linearly from 2 to 5 mph.
  - Let u = t − 6 (hours into the last segment). The speed at time t is s(t) = 2 + (3/2)u (because it increases by 3 mph over 2 hours).
  - Distance from 6 to t equals the area of a trapezoid: average speed × time = [(s(6) + s(t))/2] × u = [(2 + (2 + 1.5u))/2] × u = [ (4 + 1.5u)/2 ] × u = 2u + 0.75u^2.
  - Set 19 + (2u + 0.75u^2) = 24 ⇒ 0.75u^2 + 2u − 5 = 0 ⇒ multiply by 4: 3u^2 + 8u − 20 = 0.
  - Solve: u = [−8 + sqrt(64 + 240)] / 6 = [−8 + sqrt(304)] / 6 ≈ [−8 + 17.436] / 6 ≈ 9.436 / 6 ≈ 1.573.
  - Therefore t = 6 + u ≈ 6 + 1.573 ≈ 7.573 hours, which rounds to approximately 7.6 hours.</p>

<h2>Question 75:</h2>

<p>Based on the described velocity-time graph, what is the average speed of the object over the interval 0 ≤ t ≤ 16 seconds?
A) 1.5 m/s
B) 2.5 m/s
C) 8/3 m/s
D) 3.5 m/s</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>- Average speed = total distance traveled ÷ total time.
- On a velocity-time graph, total distance is the area between the graph and the t-axis, taking absolute values (areas below the axis count positively).

Compute distance by segments:
- 0 to 4: Triangle with base 4 and height 6 → distance = (1/2)(4)(6) = 12.
- 4 to 8: Trapezoid with bases 6 and 2 over width 4 → distance = [(6 + 2)/2](4) = 16.
- 8 to 12: Rectangle with speed 2 for 4 seconds → distance = (2)(4) = 8.
- 12 to 16: Velocity rises from -2 to 4; it crosses 0 at t = 12 + (2/1.5) = 13⅓.
  - 12 to 13⅓: Triangle with base 4/3 and height 2 → distance = (1/2)(4/3)(2) = 4/3.
  - 13⅓ to 16: Triangle with base 8/3 and height 4 → distance = (1/2)(8/3)(4) = 16/3.
  - Total for 12 to 16: 4/3 + 16/3 = 20/3.

Total distance = 12 + 16 + 8 + 20/3 = 36 + 20/3 = 128/3.
Average speed = (128/3) ÷ 16 = 128/48 = 8/3 m/s.</p>

<h2>Question 76:</h2>

<p>Given DE ∥ BC and the angle labels above, what is the measure of ∠ABC?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>- Because DE ∥ BC, triangle ADE is similar to triangle ABC (by AA similarity):
  - ∠DAE corresponds to ∠A.
  - ∠ADE corresponds to ∠B.
  - ∠DEA corresponds to ∠C.
- In triangle ADE, the three angles are ∠DAE = 70°, ∠ADE = 3x + 5°, and ∠DEA = 2x − 15°.
- Sum of angles in triangle ADE equals 180°:
  70 + (3x + 5) + (2x − 15) = 180
  5x + 60 = 180
  5x = 120
  x = 24
- Therefore, ∠B = ∠ADE = 3x + 5 = 3(24) + 5 = 72 + 5 = 77°.</p>

<h2>Question 77:</h2>

<p>Given that ray CD bisects the exterior angle ∠ACE and ∠ACD = 50°, with ∠A = 2x + 15° and ∠B = x + 25°, what is the value of x?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>- The exterior angle at C, ∠ACE, equals the sum of the two remote interior angles of the triangle: ∠ACE = ∠A + ∠B.
- Since CD bisects ∠ACE and ∠ACD = 50°, the full exterior angle is ∠ACE = 2 × 50° = 100°.
- Therefore, ∠A + ∠B = 100°. Substitute the given expressions:
  (2x + 15) + (x + 25) = 100
  3x + 40 = 100
  3x = 60
  x = 20.</p>

<h2>Question 78:</h2>

<p>What is the measure of angle ∠ABC ?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>- The ray AE partitions ∠CAB, so ∠A = (x + 15)° + (2x − 5)° = (3x + 10)°.
- Since ℓ ∥ BC, the angle between AC and ℓ equals the interior angle at C by corresponding angles. Thus ∠ACB = (x + 25)°.
- The exterior angle at B satisfies ∠CBD = ∠A + ∠ACB (exterior angle equals the sum of the two remote interior angles). Therefore:
  5x + 5 = (3x + 10) + (x + 25) = 4x + 35
  Solving gives x = 30.
- Compute ∠ABC. One way:
  ∠ABC = 180° − (∠A + ∠ACB) = 180° − [(3x + 10) + (x + 25)] = 180° − (4x + 35).
  Substitute x = 30: ∠ABC = 180° − (120 + 35) = 180° − 155° = 25°.
- Check: ∠CBD = 5x + 5 = 5(30) + 5 = 155°, and interior ∠ABC = 180° − 155° = 25°, consistent.</p>

<h2>Question 79:</h2>

<p>In right triangle ABC with right angle at C, the altitude from C to hypotenuse AB meets AB at D. Given AD = 9 and DB = 16, AE is the angle bisector of angle A meeting BC at E. What is the length of BE?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>- Since AD + DB = AB, we have AB = 9 + 16 = 25.
- In a right triangle, the altitude to the hypotenuse creates three similar triangles: ΔADC ~ ΔABC and ΔBDC ~ ΔABC. From similarity:
  - AC^2 = AB × AD, so AC^2 = 25 × 9 = 225 ⇒ AC = 15.
  - BC^2 = AB × DB, so BC^2 = 25 × 16 = 400 ⇒ BC = 20.
- By the Angle Bisector Theorem for AE (the bisector of ∠A), BE:EC = AB:AC = 25:15 = 5:3. Since BC = BE + EC = 20 and the ratio is 5:3, BE = (5/8) × 20 = 12.5.</p>

<h2>Question 80:</h2>

<p>In right triangle ABC with right angle at A, the altitude from A to the hypotenuse BC meets BC at D. If BD = 9 and AD = 12, what is the perimeter of triangle ABC?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>- In a right triangle, drawing the altitude from the right angle to the hypotenuse creates two smaller right triangles ABD and ADC that are each similar to the original triangle ABC and to each other.
- From this similarity, the geometric-mean relationships hold:
  - AD^2 = BD × DC
  - AB^2 = BD × BC
  - AC^2 = DC × BC
- First find DC using AD^2 = BD × DC:
  - 12^2 = 9 × DC → 144 = 9DC → DC = 16.
- Then BC = BD + DC = 9 + 16 = 25.
- Next find the legs:
  - AB^2 = BD × BC = 9 × 25 = 225 → AB = 15.
  - AC^2 = DC × BC = 16 × 25 = 400 → AC = 20.
- The perimeter is AB + AC + BC = 15 + 20 + 25 = 60.</p>

<h2>Question 81:</h2>

<p>If DE is the segment on the line through D parallel to AB and intersects AC at E, what is the length of DE?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>- By the Angle Bisector Theorem, BD/DC = AB/AC = 14/10 = 7/5. Since BD + DC = BC = 12, we have:
  BD = (7/(7+5))·12 = (7/12)·12 = 7 and DC = (5/12)·12 = 5.
- Because DE is drawn parallel to AB, triangles DEC and CBA are similar (corresponding sides are parallel).
- The similarity ratio (scale factor from triangle CBA to triangle DEC) is DC/CB = 5/12.
- Corresponding sides give DE/BA = DC/CB, so DE = BA · (DC/CB) = 14 · (5/12) = 70/12 = 35/6.</p>

<h2>Question 82:</h2>

<p>Given the diagram and information above, what is the length TM?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>- Because TO passes through the center, the secant along TO intersects the circle at E and F with O as the midpoint of EF. Along the line TO, we have TE = TO − r and TF = TO + r.
- By the power of a point theorem for a tangent and secant from T: TA^2 = TE × TF.
  Substituting TE and TF: TA^2 = (TO − r)(TO + r) = TO^2 − r^2.
  With TA = 12 and TO = 13:
  12^2 = 13^2 − r^2
  144 = 169 − r^2
  r^2 = 25 → r = 5.
- Consider triangle OAM. OA is a radius perpendicular to the tangent at A, so ∠OAM = 90°. The line OM is colinear with OB, hence ∠AOM = ∠AOB = 120°. In right triangle OAM, tan(∠AOM) = AM / OA.
  Therefore, AM = r · tan(120°).
  Since tan(120°) = −√3, the length AM = 5√3 (take the positive length).
- TM is the sum of TA and AM along the tangent: TM = TA + AM = 12 + 5√3.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A) 12 + 5  
B) 12 + 5√2  
C) 12 + 5√3  
D) 5√3

Correct Answer: C</p>

<h2>Question 83:</h2>

<p>Given the diagram and lengths PT = 12, PA = 8, and PB = 18, what is the distance OP?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>- Since the line through P intersects the circle at A and B and passes through the center O, AB is a diameter. Therefore, AB = PB − PA = 18 − 8 = 10, so the radius r = AB/2 = 5.
- The Power of a Point theorem gives two equivalent expressions for the power of P with respect to the circle:
  1) For the secant: PA × PB = 8 × 18 = 144.
  2) For the tangent: PT^2 = 12^2 = 144.
  These agree, confirming consistency.
- The power can also be expressed in terms of the center: PT^2 = OP^2 − r^2. Substitute PT^2 = 144 and r = 5:
  144 = OP^2 − 25
  OP^2 = 169
  OP = 13</p>

<h2>Question 84:</h2>

<p>From point P outside a circle with center O, two tangents PA and PB are drawn to the circle at A and B. A secant from P intersects the circle at C and D, with PC = 8 and PD = 18. If ∠APB = 120°, what is the radius of the circle?

A) 6√3
B) 8√3
C) 12√3
D) 30</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>- Power of a Point: For an external point P, the square of the tangent length equals the product of the secant segment lengths. Thus:
  PT^2 = PC × PD = 8 × 18 = 144, so PT = 12. Since PA and PB are tangents from P, PA = PB = 12.
- Angle between tangents: OP bisects the angle ∠APB (a known property—OP is the angle bisector of the angle formed by two tangents).
- Consider right triangle APO. OA ⟂ AP, so ∠OAP = 90°. The angle at P is ∠APO = (1/2)∠APB = 60°.
- In right triangle APO, tan(∠APO) = opposite/adjacent = OA/AP = r/12. Therefore r = 12 × tan(60°) = 12 × √3 = 12√3.</p>

  AB = √[(6 − (−2))^2 + (−1 − 3)^2] = √[8^2 + (−4)^2] = √(64 + 16) = √80 = 4√5.
  Radius r = (1/2)·AB = 2√5.
- The line y = x + c can be written in standard form as x − y + c = 0.
- The distance from the center M(2, 1) to the line x − y + c = 0 is
  d = |(2) − (1) + c| / √(1^2 + (−1)^2) = |1 + c| / √2.
- For tangency, this distance equals the radius: |1 + c| / √2 = 2√5.
  So |1 + c| = 2√5 · √2 = 2√10.
  Thus 1 + c = ± 2√10, giving c = −1 ± 2√10.
- Since c > 0, choose c = −1 + 2√10.

Correct answer: C) 2√10 − 1</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A) √10 − 1
B) 2√5 − 1

<h2>Question 86:</h2>

<p>Triangle ABC has vertices A(−2, 4), B(6, 4), and C(2, 12). The circle passing through A, B, and C is drawn. What is the equation of the tangent line to the circle at point A?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>- The tangent to a circle at a point is perpendicular to the radius drawn to that point. So we need the slope of the radius OA, where O is the circumcenter.
- Find O by intersecting two perpendicular bisectors:
  1) For AB: The midpoint of AB is M_AB = ((−2+6)/2, (4+4)/2) = (2, 4). Since AB is horizontal, its perpendicular bisector is the vertical line x = 2.
  2) For AC: The midpoint of AC is M_AC = ((−2+2)/2, (4+12)/2) = (0, 8). The slope of AC is (12 − 4)/(2 − (−2)) = 8/4 = 2, so the slope of its perpendicular bisector is −1/2. Its equation through M_AC is y − 8 = (−1/2)(x − 0), or y = −(1/2)x + 8.
- The circumcenter O is the intersection of x = 2 and y = −(1/2)x + 8, which gives y = −1 + 8 = 7, so O = (2, 7).
- Slope of OA: From O(2, 7) to A(−2, 4), slope m_OA = (4 − 7)/(−2 − 2) = (−3)/(−4) = 3/4.
- The tangent’s slope is the negative reciprocal: m_tangent = −4/3.
- Equation of the tangent line through A(−2, 4): y − 4 = (−4/3)(x − (−2)) = (−4/3)(x + 2). Simplify: y = (−4/3)x − 8/3 + 4 = (−4/3)x + 4/3.

Therefore, the equation of the tangent line at A is y = (−4/3)x + 4/3.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A) y = (−4/3)x + 4/3
B) y = (3/4)x + 11/2
C) y = (−3/4)x + 11/2
D) y = (4/3)x − 4/3

Correct Answer: A</p>

<h2>Question 87:</h2>

<p>The circle with center C(1, 2) and radius √40 is shown in the coordinate plane. The line y = 3x − 1 intersects the circle at two points P and Q. A tangent line to the circle at point P (the intersection point with the greater x-coordinate) is drawn. What is the x-coordinate of the point where this tangent line intersects the x-axis?

A) −13
B) 7
C) 24
D) 27</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>1) Find the intersection points of the circle and the line.
   - Circle: (x − 1)² + (y − 2)² = 40
   - Line: y = 3x − 1
   Substitute y into the circle:
   (x − 1)² + (3x − 1 − 2)² = 40
   (x − 1)² + (3x − 3)² = 40
   (x − 1)² + 9(x − 1)² = 40
   10(x − 1)² = 40 ⇒ (x − 1)² = 4 ⇒ x − 1 = ±2
   So x = 3 or x = −1. Using y = 3x − 1, the points are:
   - P(3, 8) and Q(−1, −4). Since P has the greater x-coordinate, P = (3, 8).

2) Use the fact that the tangent at a point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point.
   - Slope of radius CP: (8 − 2)/(3 − 1) = 6/2 = 3.
   - Therefore, slope of the tangent at P is the negative reciprocal: m_tan = −1/3.

3) Write the equation of the tangent line through P(3, 8) with slope −1/3:
   y − 8 = −(1/3)(x − 3) ⇒ y = −(1/3)x + 9.

4) Find the x-intercept of the tangent by setting y = 0:
   0 = −(1/3)x + 9 ⇒ (1/3)x = 9 ⇒ x = 27.

Therefore, the tangent at P intersects the x-axis at x = 27.</p>

<h2>Question 88:</h2>

<p>What is the length of BD?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>- In a right triangle, tan(A) = opposite/adjacent = BC/AB. Given tan(A) = 4/3, let AB = 3k and BC = 4k for some positive k.
- By the Pythagorean theorem, AC = √(AB^2 + BC^2) = √((3k)^2 + (4k)^2) = √(9k^2 + 16k^2) = √(25k^2) = 5k.
- Since AC = 25, we have 5k = 25 ⇒ k = 5. Thus AB = 15 and BC = 20.
- The area of triangle ABC can be computed in two ways:
  1) Using legs: Area = (1/2)(AB)(BC) = (1/2)(15)(20) = 150.
  2) Using hypotenuse and altitude: Area = (1/2)(AC)(BD) = (1/2)(25)(BD) = 12.5·BD.
- Set the areas equal: 150 = 12.5·BD ⇒ BD = 150 / 12.5 = 12.</p>

<h2>Question 89:</h2>

<p>A person stands at point P on level ground and observes the top T of a vertical tower at point B with an angle of elevation of 30°. After walking 100 meters directly toward the tower to point Q along the same line, the angle of elevation to T is 45°. What is the height h of the tower, in meters?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>- Let x be the horizontal distance from P to the base B of the tower. Then PB = x and QB = x − 100.
- Using tangent (opposite over adjacent) at point P: tan(30°) = h/x = √3/3, so h = x(√3/3).
- Using tangent at point Q: tan(45°) = h/(x − 100) = 1, so h = x − 100.
- Set the two expressions for h equal: x(√3/3) = x − 100.
- Multiply both sides by 3: x√3 = 3x − 300 → 3x − x√3 = 300 → x(3 − √3) = 300 → x = 300/(3 − √3).
- Rationalize to simplify x: x = [300/(3 − √3)]·[(3 + √3)/(3 + √3)] = 300(3 + √3)/6 = 50(3 + √3).
- Then h = x − 100 = 50(3 + √3) − 100 = 50(3 + √3 − 2) = 50(√3 + 1).
- Approximate check: √3 ≈ 1.732, so h ≈ 50(2.732) ≈ 136.6 meters.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A) 100√3
B) 50(√3 + 1)
C) 100(√3 − 1)
D) 150
E) 200

Correct Answer: B</p>

<h2>Question 90:</h2>

<p>In the diagram described, the tangent line at P intersects the x-axis at T, and OT = 3. What is tan θ?

A) √2
B) 2√2
C) 2
D) √8/3
E) 3</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>- The radius OP is perpendicular to the tangent line at P. The slope of OP is tan θ because OP runs from (0,0) to (cos θ, sin θ).
- Therefore, the slope of the tangent line at P is the negative reciprocal: m = −cot θ = −(cos θ)/(sin θ).
- Equation of the tangent line through P is y − sin θ = −(cos θ/sin θ)(x − cos θ).
- To find the x-intercept T, set y = 0:
  0 − sin θ = −(cos θ/sin θ)(x_T − cos θ)
  Multiply both sides by sin θ:
  −sin^2 θ = −cos θ (x_T − cos θ)
  sin^2 θ = cos θ x_T − cos^2 θ
  cos θ x_T = sin^2 θ + cos^2 θ = 1
  x_T = 1 / cos θ = sec θ
- Thus OT = x_T = sec θ. Given OT = 3, we have sec θ = 3 ⇒ cos θ = 1/3.
- Then sin θ = √(1 − cos^2 θ) = √(1 − 1/9) = √(8/9) = (2√2)/3.
- Therefore tan θ = sin θ / cos θ = ((2√2)/3) / (1/3) = 2√2.</p>
