<h2>Question 1:</h2>

<div class="passage">We tend to comfort ourselves with tidy histories of innovation: a lone inventor has an idea, perfects a device, and ushers in a new era. But who gets remembered as the inventor often owes as much to storytelling and networks as to the invention itself. In 1907, Eliza Freund, a mechanical engineer working in a cramped workshop above a bakery, assembled a compact water filtration unit meant for tenement buildings. Her design, modest and sturdy, solved problems of cost and maintenance that had deterred landlords from installing filters. She published her schematics in a municipal engineering journal and demonstrated the unit at neighborhood meetings, where parents took home handwritten pamphlets.

Two years later, a well-funded manufacturer released a polished, chrome-laden filtration system that employed Freund’s core principles—rapid sand filtration and modular cleaning—yet tucked them inside a gleaming casing. The company hired illustrators, secured endorsements from city physicians, and distributed free samples to schools. Within a decade, museum displays featured the manufacturer’s model behind glass, and textbook timelines paired its debut with “the dawn of urban water safety.” Freund’s unit, which had quietly reduced illness in crowded buildings, receded into footnotes.

It is tempting to interpret this erasure as intentional theft, but the explanation is usually less conspiratorial and more systemic. The artifacts we elevate are the ones easiest to narrate and display, with names attached, dates convenient, and images that photograph well. Textbooks require a short arc; museum placards are brief. Engineers like Freund who publish in local journals, adapt designs iteratively, and sell to small clients create stories with frayed edges. Their work feeds progress, yet resists the neat plotlines we learn to memorize. If we want to honor innovation honestly, we must widen the aperture: recognize that progress tracks with story as much as with invention, and remember that credit is a fragile thing, easily guided by the hands that arrange the exhibits.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which choice best expresses the main claim of the passage?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>The passage argues that public recognition of innovation is influenced not solely by technical achievement but by the narratives, networks, and presentation that make certain inventions memorable and visible. The example of Freund’s filtration unit versus the manufacturer’s polished model illustrates how marketing, endorsements, and textbook-friendly stories create lasting credit. Therefore, the best statement of the claim emphasizes the role of storytelling and networks in determining who is remembered. Choice A contradicts the passage’s argument by implying technical excellence inevitably prevails. Choice C reduces the issue to patents, which the passage never presents as the central factor. Choice D imputes motives (lack of ambition) that are neither stated nor supported. Choice B captures the passage’s thesis.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A) Technical excellence inevitably prevails over weak marketing in determining historical credit.
B) Public recognition of innovation depends on narrative and networks as much as on invention itself. [Correct]
C) Patents are the primary safeguard for preserving inventors’ historical credit.
D) Early inventors were generally less ambitious than later, better-funded manufacturers.</p>

<h2>Question 2:</h2>

<div class="passage">At the town hall meeting, the old library stood at the center of a forked conversation. On one side were those who celebrated its concrete bravado, its deep-set windows that kept summer glare at bay, its generous steps that doubled as seating for impromptu lectures. On the other side were the people who had pushed strollers up those steps, who had searched for a ramp and found a locked service door, who reminded us that grandeur can forget the ordinary body.

As a historian, I felt the tug of both narratives. The library is not simply a building; it is a document of an era that believed in civic heft. But history is not absolution. In my remarks, I tried to temper my admiration with a practical accounting: leaks that bloom into brown maps across the ceiling tiles; a heating system that coughs loudly through winter; lighting that warms the stacks unevenly. These are not defects in principle, but demands in practice. I do not endorse demolition lightly; erasure, too, costs something. Yet I would rather read a building that learns than one that insists on being reread the same way forever.

After the meeting, someone asked if compromise was betrayal. I resisted the lure of purity. The library can be reborn with better circulation without surrendering its stubborn, dignified weight. To pretend otherwise is to mistake rigidity for fidelity. The past asks for our attention, yes, but it also asks for our imagination. If we care, we must care all the way down—to the budgets, the boilers, the bulbs—and not only to the stories we tell ourselves about what concrete might symbolize.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> In the sentence “In my remarks, I tried to temper my admiration with a practical accounting,” the word “temper” most nearly means</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>In context, the narrator balances enthusiasm for the library’s design with a realistic assessment of its flaws and costs. “Temper” here means to moderate or mitigate one thing (admiration) by introducing another (practical accounting). It does not mean to “anger” (as in bad temper), to “harden” (as in tempering steel), or to “flavor” (as in adding seasoning). The surrounding sentences emphasize balancing praise with pragmatic concerns, supporting the sense of moderation.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A) anger
B) harden
C) moderate
D) flavor</p>

<h2>Question 3:</h2>

<div class="passage">Lina had not expected the room to be so bright; the ceiling fixtures hummed and the municipal seal gleamed behind the dais. Mayor Hale thanked “partners” and gestured toward the woman with a silver lanyard from Northstar Visual Systems, who gave a small, contained nod. He spoke of “coherence” and “wayfinding” and the “grant cycle” that required “deliverables” by May, easing his phrasing as if the words should sound neighborly. The hand-painted shop signs that had once distinguished Maple Street, he said, made for charming postcards but “inconsistent legibility.” The council members shifted to look at the slide showing standardized mock-ups: pale blue, clean type.

When it was Lina’s turn, she described varnish that had darkened over decades, letterforms traced slowly on wood salvaged from a mill. Two residents clapped. The mayor smiled and said, “We treasure our heritage. That’s why Northstar proposes a pilot corridor; professional installers, minimum disruption.” He glanced again at the lanyard, and the woman began to jot something on a card.

“We’d love your touch on a commemorative plaque,” the mayor added, turning his palms out as if offering a compromise. “A little history beside the new signs. And we’d welcome any colors you feel capture Maple Street—within the accessibility palette, of course.” He tapped the slide where “approved hues” arrayed like a controlled rainbow. “The quick wins will let us submit metrics early.”

Lina watched a councilor whisper to another, eyes flicking to the clock. She knew what the words meant: points scored where they could be counted, a token for the old ways. The artisan’s work would survive as sepia captions beside aluminum.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> It can reasonably be inferred from the passage that Mayor Hale’s intended role for Lina is primarily what?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>The mayor’s comments and the context suggest he has already committed to standardized signage handled by “professional installers” on a “pilot corridor,” driven by a “grant cycle” and “deliverables.” When addressing Lina’s contributions, he offers a “commemorative plaque” and limited input on colors “within the accessibility palette,” signaling constraints rather than genuine creative control. The emphasis on “quick wins” and submitting “metrics early” further indicates the project’s timeline and substance are set. Together, these details imply Lina’s involvement is largely symbolic, not central to decision-making or execution.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A. Overseeing the design and installation of all new signage
B. Contributing in a limited, ceremonial capacity rather than making substantive decisions
C. Delaying the project to collect broader community input guided by Lina
D. Proposing alternatives that preserve all original hand-painted signs

Correct answer: B</p>

<h2>Question 4:</h2>

<div class="passage">For nearly two decades, “green roofs” have been promoted as a way to slash building energy bills, their insulation layers and vegetation touted as natural air conditioners. Yet the most reliable value of green roofs has little to do with thermostats. Energy savings do occur, but they vary widely with climate, roof design, and building use; a shallow, sunbaked roof in Phoenix will perform differently than a thick, irrigated one in Portland. By contrast, ecological and hydrological benefits are both steadier and more far-reaching.

Even the thinnest vegetated roof slows stormwater, absorbing and holding rainfall that would otherwise overwhelm city sewers. Studies consistently find retention of a third to half of precipitation during moderate storms, delaying peak runoff and filtering pollutants as water percolates through substrate. Green roofs also stitch bits of habitat back into cities. While no rooftop can host an oak forest, sedum mats and native grasses support bees, butterflies, and ground-nesting birds. A mosaic of small roof meadows, distributed across neighborhoods, functions as a corridor that allows pollinators to move, feed, and reproduce, bolstering urban biodiversity in ways a single park cannot.

These benefits are not automatic: thoughtful design matters. Choosing native species suited to wind and sun, providing varied microhabitats, and committing to modest maintenance can turn a decorative layer into a living system. Policymakers should therefore stop treating green roofs as a thin layer of insulation and start treating them as pieces of ecological infrastructure. Energy performance is a welcome bonus where it occurs, but the most dependable reason to invest in green roofs is their capacity to manage water and restore fragments of nature atop the city.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which choice best states the main idea of the passage?

A) Green roofs consistently cut building energy costs and should be adopted primarily for their insulating properties. 
B) Although green roofs can reduce energy use in some cases, their most dependable value lies in stormwater management and urban biodiversity, which warrant treating them as ecological infrastructure. 
C) Green roofs are difficult to design and maintain, so cities should limit them to parks and large public buildings. 
D) The benefits of green roofs are overstated because they cannot support large trees or forest ecosystems.</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>The passage argues that while energy savings from green roofs are variable, their ecological and hydrological benefits—stormwater retention and habitat creation—are consistent and significant. It supports this claim with details about rainfall retention, pollutant filtration, and the role of rooftop meadows in supporting pollinators and birds. The author concludes that policymakers should view green roofs as ecological infrastructure and consider energy performance a bonus. Choice B captures this central claim and the emphasis on reliable benefits and policy implications. Choice A overstates energy consistency and misidentifies insulation as the primary reason for adoption, contradicting the passage. Choice C focuses on design difficulty to argue for limiting deployment; the passage acknowledges design and maintenance but presents them as manageable steps, not reasons to restrict green roofs. Choice D dismisses benefits because roofs can’t host large trees, ignoring the passage’s point that small habitats collectively provide meaningful ecological value.</p>

<h2>Question 5:</h2>

<div class="passage">On a rain-slick Tuesday, our town’s bakery retired the jam-smudged index card where customers wrote special orders and unveiled a glowing tablet instead. The first few minutes were a choreography of polite confusion: regulars hunting for pens that no longer existed, the baker wiping flour off his hands to explain the “submit” button. No one doubted the tablet’s promise—fewer lost cards, faster tallies—but some hesitated, as if the new device had subtly rearranged the room’s familiar warmth.

We tend to measure upgrades by throughput and error rates, as if speed and precision were the only currencies of value. Yet routines carry meanings that statistics do not tally. The index card had made waiting feel like participating; scribbles were little acts of belonging. Replacing such artifacts is not merely a logistical choice—it is a cultural one.

Does that mean we should cling to paper at all costs? Hardly. The refusal to change can calcify a place as surely as reckless modernization can estrange it. The question is not whether technology is good or bad but how it is introduced: Does it relieve friction without erasing the texture that tells people they are part of something?

A practical standard emerges from that question. Adopt tools that do invisible work—process payments, track orders, prevent mistakes—while preserving visible rituals that invite people in. In the bakery, that could mean keeping a small stack of cards for those who want them, while using the tablet to manage the chaos behind the counter. Efficiency need not be a neon sign; it can be the quiet current beneath a counter’s wood grain.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which choice best describes how the author organizes the passage to advance the central argument?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>The author begins with a concrete anecdote (the bakery’s shift from index cards to a tablet) to humanize the issue and establish stakes beyond mere efficiency. The passage then broadens to a general reflection on how upgrades are typically evaluated, highlighting the cultural meaning of routines. Next, the author poses a rhetorical question to pivot into a concession, acknowledging that resisting change can be as harmful as embracing it uncritically. Finally, the author proposes a measured standard for adopting technology and returns to the anecdote to illustrate how that principle could look in practice. This structure—anecdote, generalization, concession, recommendation—advances the central argument for selective, culturally sensitive adoption of technology. Therefore, choice A is correct. Choices B, C, and D misrepresent the structure: the passage does not begin with a historical overview (B), does not hinge on technical definitions (C), and does not present sequential studies or avoid conclusions (D).</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A. Begins with a specific anecdote, broadens to general principles, acknowledges a counterconsideration, and concludes with a measured recommendation.
B. Opens with a historical overview, refutes it with data, and urges an immediate halt to technological change.
C. Defines technical terms in detail, applies those definitions to a forecast, and warns of long-term consequences.
D. Presents two studies in sequence to compare outcomes but stops short of drawing a conclusion.</p>

<h2>Question 6:</h2>

<div class="passage">Last spring, the city council floated a plan to “modernize” the river path by granting a private company exclusive rights to manage access. The proposal arrived dressed in efficiency: rubberized lanes, timed gates, a subscription tier promising “premium vistas.” I read the brochure and wondered if the river had changed while I wasn’t looking. Had water learned to discriminate between residents and non-members? Would the sun need a badge to set over the western bank?

On Tuesday evening, the plan’s supporters spoke of wear and tear, budgets, and “unlocking value.” Their slides showed graphs rising dutifully, as though upward lines were a moral argument. But anyone who walked the path last summer could tell you what those lines omitted: the fisherman with a thermos balanced on the railing; the schoolkids inventing races between lampposts; the nurse finishing a night shift, resting on the cool stones; the hush that collects at dusk when the river matches your breath. Since when do we charge for sunlight?

Of course, I know the city ledger isn’t a poem. Pavement cracks. Storms bite. Someone has to pay for repairs. Still, there’s a difference between public maintenance and converting the ordinary grace of a place into a subscription. The brochure’s language—“curated experiences,” “exclusive wellness corridors”—reads like an instruction manual for forgetting what the path already does without our permission. It steadies people. It gathers them. It makes living together feel less like a transaction and more like a habit.

If modernization means soldering a turnstile onto that habit, then the cost is not measured in dollars but in the brittleness we teach ourselves to accept. Leave the path open. Patch the pavement. Let the graphs flatten if they must. And let the river keep its job: reminding us that value sometimes arrives without asking for a gate.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> In context, the rhetorical question “Since when do we charge for sunlight?” primarily serves to achieve which effect?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>The rhetorical question underscores the author’s view that monetizing access to the river path is fundamentally absurd, highlighting the mismatch between natural, freely available experiences and the proposal’s transactional framing. By invoking “sunlight,” a universally free and public good, the question dramatizes how the plan commodifies something that ought to remain shared, thereby reinforcing the critique. It does not introduce new evidence, suggest a feasible revenue stream, or present a counterexample; rather, it heightens the emotional and ethical force of the argument by framing the proposal as self-evidently unreasonable.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A. Appeal to the reader’s sense of logical precision by demanding a historical timeline of policy changes.
B. Dramatize the perceived absurdity of monetizing a public, natural experience, strengthening the author’s critique.
C. Suggest that charging for natural amenities could offer a practical way to raise municipal revenue.
D. Introduce a counterexample that undermines the council’s claim about maintenance costs.

Correct answer: B</p>

<h2>Question 7:</h2>

<div class="passage">Data table: Average attendees per session at a city library’s programs, by age group
- Writing Workshop — Teens: 9; Adults: 24; Seniors: 6; Children: 0
- Coding Club — Teens: 21; Adults: 13; Seniors: 2; Children: 0
- History Lecture — Teens: 5; Adults: 27; Seniors: 16; Children: 0
- Family Storytime — Teens: 0; Adults: 8; Seniors: 2; Children: 32

In proposing the next quarter’s schedule, the library director argues that evening slots should prioritize programs with strong teen engagement. “Teens are underrepresented in our Writing Workshop compared to adults,” she notes, “but they are a major presence in the Coding Club—roughly half of attendees there are teens. Meanwhile, seniors are a core audience for the History Lecture, and children overwhelmingly populate Family Storytime.”</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Based on the data, which choice best evaluates the director’s claim that “roughly half of attendees [at Coding Club] are teens”?

A. Supported; teens compose a majority of Coding Club attendees, about 58 percent.
B. Refuted; teens constitute less than one-third of Coding Club attendees.
C. Refuted; adults and seniors combined outnumber teens at Coding Club.
D. Supported; teens make up exactly half of Coding Club attendees.</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>Coding Club attendance totals 21 (teens) + 13 (adults) + 2 (seniors) + 0 (children) = 36 attendees per session on average. Teens account for 21 of 36, which is about 58 percent. This is more than half, and “roughly half” is reasonably captured by a statement noting a majority near 50 percent. Choice A correctly evaluates the claim. Choice B is incorrect because 21/36 is greater than one-third. Choice C is incorrect because adults plus seniors (13 + 2 = 15) do not outnumber teens (21). Choice D is incorrect because teens do not make up exactly half.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A. Supported; teens compose a majority of Coding Club attendees, about 58 percent. (Correct)
B. Refuted; teens constitute less than one-third of Coding Club attendees.
C. Refuted; adults and seniors combined outnumber teens at Coding Club.
D. Supported; teens make up exactly half of Coding Club attendees.</p>

<h2>Question 8:</h2>

<div class="text-to-edit">While reviewing the data, discrepancies were noticed by the committee, and they decided to postpone the vote, which was sudden.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which choice best revises the sentence to correct the modifier error and improve clarity and concision while maintaining the original meaning?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>The original sentence contains a dangling modifier: "While reviewing the data" appears to modify "discrepancies," which cannot review data. The subject performing the action should immediately follow the introductory phrase. Choice A places "the committee" after the modifier, uses active voice, and removes the vague and awkward "which was sudden," yielding a clear and concise sentence. Choice B corrects the modifier but relies on passive constructions and adds the unnecessary "suddenly." Choice C keeps the ambiguous "which was sudden," which could modify either the vote or the decision, and is wordier than necessary. Choice D is excessively wordy and passive ("it was noticed," "a postponement of the vote was made"), reducing clarity.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A. While reviewing the data, the committee noticed discrepancies and decided to postpone the vote.
B. While the data were being reviewed, discrepancies were noticed by the committee, and the vote was postponed suddenly.
C. The committee noticed discrepancies while reviewing the data, and they decided to postpone the vote, which was sudden.
D. While reviewing the data, it was noticed by the committee that discrepancies existed, and therefore a postponement of the vote was made.</p>

<h2>Question 9:</h2>

<div class="text-to-edit">While reading the novel, the themes were confusing.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which choice best revises the sentence to correct the grammatical error and clarify the meaning?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>The introductory phrase "While reading the novel" is a modifier that should clearly describe the subject of the main clause. In the original sentence, the subject is "the themes," which cannot read a novel; this creates a dangling modifier. Choice C correctly supplies a logical subject ("I") to match the modifier and clearly states the idea. Choice A repeats the error. Choice B still leaves the modifier dangling because "confusion" cannot read. Choice D keeps the illogical subject ("the themes") as the one reading, so the modifier remains misplaced.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>- A) While reading the novel, the themes were confusing.
- B) While reading the novel, confusion over the themes arose.
- C) While reading the novel, I found the themes confusing.
- D) The themes were confusing while reading the novel.</p>

<h2>Question 10:</h2>

<div class="text-to-edit">Punctuation seems minor, it shapes how readers understand a sentence. For instance, the phrase "Let's eat, Grandma" shows why commas matter; without them, the meaning changes drastically.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which choice best revises the underlined sentence (the first sentence) to correct the punctuation error and most effectively emphasize the contrast between how punctuation looks and what it does?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>The original first sentence contains a comma splice: two independent clauses joined only by a comma. Several revisions fix the splice, but the question asks specifically to emphasize contrast. Choice C uses the coordinating conjunction "but" with a comma to create a clear contrast between appearance (seems minor) and impact (shapes understanding). Choices A and D correctly join the clauses (semicolon or colon) but do not emphasize contrast, and choice B (em dash) adds emphasis without signaling a clear contrast. Therefore, Choice C is best.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A. Punctuation seems minor; it shapes how readers understand a sentence.
B. Punctuation seems minor—it shapes how readers understand a sentence.
C. Punctuation seems minor, but it shapes how readers understand a sentence.

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which choice best revises the sentence to improve conciseness and clarity?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>Choice B eliminates redundant phrases (“at this point in time,” “decided to postpone making,” “until such time as”) and uses a direct, active construction. Choices C and D retain wordiness and repetition (“decided,” “decision,” “making”) or introduce awkward phrasing and tense inconsistency. Choice A is overly verbose.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>A) NO CHANGE
B) The committee postponed the final decision until more data could be collected.
C) The committee members, at the current time, postponed making the final decision until there is more data.

<h2>Question 12:</h2>

<div class="text-to-edit">The Riverwatch Club is organizing a cleanup day along Mill Creek this Saturday. Volunteers will meet at 8 a.m. near the footbridge, and the club will supply gloves and trash bags. [Mill Creek was named after the sawmill that attracted early settlers in 1827.] After the cleanup, participants will log the types of litter collected and share the results with the city council to guide future waste-reduction efforts.</div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> To improve the paragraph’s logical flow and maintain focus on the event, what should the writer do with the bracketed sentence?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>The paragraph focuses on announcing and describing the cleanup event: when and where volunteers meet, what supplies are provided, and how data will be used. The historical detail about how Mill Creek got its name does not contribute to understanding the event and interrupts the sequence of relevant information. Deleting the sentence preserves coherence and keeps the reader’s attention on the event’s logistics and purpose. Moving the sentence to the beginning or end still introduces irrelevant information and distracts from the main point.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which choice most effectively revises the last sentence to match the formal, objective tone of the passage?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>The passage maintains a formal, informative tone in the first two sentences. The original last sentence shifts to casual slang (“totally lit”), second-person address (“smacks you”), and idiomatic phrasing, which undermines consistency. The best revision should use precise, neutral language and an appropriate transition that fits a formal context.</p>

<p>A. In addition, the audio guide provides key information from the outset.
B. Also, the audio guide is totally lit and hits you with cool facts right away.
C. Plus, the audio guide kinda throws neat info at you first thing.
D. And the audio guide immediately blasts listeners with fun facts.

Correct Answer: A

Why A is correct:
- “In addition” is a formal transitional phrase that aligns with the passage’s tone.
- “Provides key information from the outset” is precise and objective, avoiding slang, second-person address, and idioms.

Why the others are not:
- B uses slang (“totally lit”) and second-person phrasing (“hits you”), which is informal and inconsistent with the passage’s tone.
- C includes informal diction (“kinda,” “neat info”) and idiomatic phrasing, which diminishes the formal style.
- D uses informal, figurative language (“blasts… fun facts”) and a casual transition (“And”), making the tone less professional.</p>

<h2>Question 15:</h2>

<p>Consider the system of linear equations x + k y = 7 and 3x − 2y = 1, where k is an integer between −10 and 10 inclusive. For those values of k for which the system has a solution (x, y) with both x and y integers, what is the sum of all possible values of k?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>Solve the system in terms of k. From x + k y = 7, write x = 7 − k y. Substitute into 3x − 2y = 1:
3(7 − k y) − 2y = 1
21 − 3k y − 2y = 1
(−3k − 2) y = −20
y = 20 / (3k + 2)

For y to be an integer, 3k + 2 must be a divisor of 20. The integer divisors of 20 are ±1, ±2, ±4, ±5, ±10, ±20. Set 3k + 2 equal to each divisor and solve for k:
- 3k + 2 = 1 → k = −1/3 (not integer)
- 3k + 2 = −1 → k = −1 (valid)
- 3k + 2 = 2 → k = 0 (valid)
- 3k + 2 = −2 → k = −4/3 (not integer)
- 3k + 2 = 4 → k = 2/3 (not integer)
- 3k + 2 = −4 → k = −2 (valid)
- 3k + 2 = 5 → k = 1 (valid)
- 3k + 2 = −5 → k = −7/3 (not integer)
- 3k + 2 = 10 → k = 8/3 (not integer)
- 3k + 2 = −10 → k = −4 (valid)
- 3k + 2 = 20 → k = 6 (valid)
- 3k + 2 = −20 → k = −22/3 (not integer)

The valid k values in the range [−10, 10] are −4, −2, −1, 0, 1, and 6. For each such k, y is an integer, and then x = 7 − k y is also an integer. The sum of these k values is (−4) + (−2) + (−1) + 0 + 1 + 6 = 0.</p>

<h2>Question 16:</h2>

<p>How many integer values of x satisfy both inequalities |x − 4| + |x + 1| ≤ 9 and (x − 5)/(x + 2) ≥ 0?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>First, solve |x − 4| + |x + 1| ≤ 9 by breaking into cases around x = −1 and x = 4.

- For x ≤ −1:
  |x − 4| = 4 − x and |x + 1| = −x − 1, so the sum is (4 − x) + (−x − 1) = 3 − 2x ≤ 9
  ⇒ −2x ≤ 6 ⇒ x ≥ −3. Combined with x ≤ −1 gives −3 ≤ x ≤ −1.

- For −1 ≤ x ≤ 4:
  |x − 4| = 4 − x and |x + 1| = x + 1, so the sum is 5, which is ≤ 9 for all x in this interval.

- For x ≥ 4:
  |x − 4| = x − 4 and |x + 1| = x + 1, so the sum is 2x − 3 ≤ 9
  ⇒ 2x ≤ 12 ⇒ x ≤ 6. Combined with x ≥ 4 gives 4 ≤ x ≤ 6.

Combining all cases, the solution to the first inequality is −3 ≤ x ≤ 6.

Next, solve (x − 5)/(x + 2) ≥ 0. The expression is undefined at x = −2 and equals zero at x = 5. Use sign analysis:
- For x < −2: numerator (x − 5) < 0, denominator (x + 2) < 0 ⇒ ratio > 0 (included).
- For −2 < x < 5: numerator < 0, denominator > 0 ⇒ ratio < 0 (excluded).
- For x ≥ 5: numerator ≥ 0, denominator > 0 ⇒ ratio ≥ 0 (included). Note x = −2 is excluded (undefined), x = 5 is included (equals 0).

Thus, the solution to the second inequality is x < −2 or x ≥ 5.

Intersecting with −3 ≤ x ≤ 6 gives the set (−3 ≤ x < −2) ∪ (5 ≤ x ≤ 6). The integer solutions are x = −3, 5, and 6, for a total of 3 integers.</p>

<h2>Question 17:</h2>

<p>Consider the system of equations below, where t is a real parameter:
(t − 2)x + 4y = 8
3x + (t + 1)y = 5

a) For which value(s) of t does the system have no solution?
b) For which value(s) of t does the system have infinitely many solutions?
c) For t = 1, find the solution (x, y).</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>- A 2 × 2 linear system has a unique solution when the determinant of its coefficient matrix is nonzero. If the determinant is zero, the lines are either parallel distinct (no solution) or the same line (infinitely many solutions).
- The coefficient matrix is:
  [ t − 2   4 ]
  [   3    t + 1 ]
  Its determinant is Δ = (t − 2)(t + 1) − (4)(3) = t^2 − t − 14.
- If Δ ≠ 0, the system has a unique solution. If Δ = 0, we must check proportionality of the entire equations (including constants) to distinguish between no solution and infinitely many solutions.

a) Set Δ = 0:
t^2 − t − 14 = 0
Using the quadratic formula, t = (1 ± √57)/2.
At these t values, the coefficient rows are proportional (the lines have the same slope). To have infinitely many solutions, the constants must scale by the same factor as the coefficients; otherwise, the lines are parallel distinct with no solution. Let λ be the proportionality factor from the first equation to the second. From coefficients,
λ = 3/(t − 2) = (t + 1)/4.
For the constants to match, we would also need 5 = λ · 8, i.e., λ = 5/8. Solving 3/(t − 2) = 5/8 gives t = 34/5, and (t + 1)/4 = 5/8 gives t = 3/2. These do not match, so there is no t for which the entire equations are proportional. Therefore, when Δ = 0 (t = (1 ± √57)/2), the system has no solution.

b) As shown above, there is no t that makes the entire second equation a constant multiple of the first (including the constants). Therefore, there are no values of t that produce infinitely many solutions.

c) For t = 1:
Equation 1: (1 − 2)x + 4y = 8 → −x + 4y = 8 → x = 4y − 8.
Equation 2: 3x + (1 + 1)y = 5 → 3x + 2y = 5.
Substitute x = 4y − 8 into the second equation:
3(4y − 8) + 2y = 5 → 12y − 24 + 2y = 5 → 14y = 29 → y = 29/14.
Then x = 4(29/14) − 8 = 116/14 − 8 = 58/7 − 56/7 = 2/7.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>a) t = (1 + √57)/2 and t = (1 − √57)/2

<h2>Question 18:</h2>

<p>The quadratic equation x^2 − p x + q = 0 has distinct integer roots. If q − p = 7, what are all possible values of p?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>Let the roots be r and s (distinct integers). By Vieta’s formulas:
- r + s = p
- r s = q

Given q − p = 7, substitute to get:
rs − (r + s) = 7
rs − r − s + 1 = 8
(r − 1)(s − 1) = 8

Now list the integer factor pairs of 8 (order doesn’t matter since r and s are symmetric):
- (r − 1, s − 1) = (1, 8) ⇒ (r, s) = (2, 9) ⇒ p = r + s = 11
- (2, 4) ⇒ (3, 5) ⇒ p = 8
- (−1, −8) ⇒ (0, −7) ⇒ p = −7
- (−2, −4) ⇒ (−1, −3) ⇒ p = −4

In each case, r and s are distinct integers, satisfying the condition. These are the only possibilities because all integer factor pairs of 8 have been enumerated.</p>

<h2>Question 19:</h2>

<p>Let P(x) be a polynomial. When P(x) is divided by x − 1, the remainder is 5; when divided by x − 2, the remainder is 7; and when divided by x − 3, the remainder is 9. What is the remainder when P(x) is divided by (x − 1)(x − 2)(x − 3)?

A) x + 5
B) 2x + 3
C) x^2 − x + 4
D) 3x − 1</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>When a polynomial P(x) is divided by (x − 1)(x − 2)(x − 3), the remainder R(x) must be a polynomial of degree less than 3, so let R(x) = ax^2 + bx + c.

Because (x − 1), (x − 2), and (x − 3) are factors of the divisor, we have R(1) = P(1), R(2) = P(2), and R(3) = P(3). The given remainders tell us:
- R(1) = 5 → a + b + c = 5
- R(2) = 7 → 4a + 2b + c = 7
- R(3) = 9 → 9a + 3b + c = 9

Subtract the first equation from the second: 3a + b = 2.
Subtract the second from the third: 5a + b = 2.
Subtract these two new equations: (5a + b) − (3a + b) = 2 − 2 → 2a = 0 → a = 0.
Then 3a + b = 2 → b = 2. Finally, a + b + c = 5 → 0 + 2 + c = 5 → c = 3.

Therefore, R(x) = 2x + 3.</p>

<h2>Question 20:</h2>

<p>For all real x with x ≠ 2 and x ≠ −3, the identity (ax + b)/(x − 2) + (cx + d)/(x + 3) = 5 holds. If a − c = 2, what is the value of b + 3d?
A) 5/2
B) 13/2
C) 7
D) 15/2</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>- Multiply both sides by (x − 2)(x + 3) to clear denominators:
  (ax + b)(x + 3) + (cx + d)(x − 2) = 5(x^2 + x − 6)
- Expand the left-hand side:
  (ax + b)(x + 3) = a x^2 + (3a + b)x + 3b
  (cx + d)(x − 2) = c x^2 + (−2c + d)x − 2d
  Sum: (a + c)x^2 + (3a + b − 2c + d)x + (3b − 2d)
- Match coefficients with the right-hand side 5x^2 + 5x − 30:
  1) a + c = 5
  2) 3a + b − 2c + d = 5
  3) 3b − 2d = −30
- Given a − c = 2 and a + c = 5:
  Solve: a = 7/2, c = 3/2
- Use equation (2):
  3a + b − 2c + d = 5 ⇒ 3*(7/2) + b − 2*(3/2) + d = 5 ⇒ 21/2 − 3 + b + d = 5 ⇒ b + d = −5/2
- Use equation (3):
  3b − 2d = −30
- Solve the system:
  From b + d = −5/2 ⇒ b = −5/2 − d
  Substitute into 3b − 2d = −30:
  3(−5/2 − d) − 2d = −30 ⇒ −15/2 − 5d = −30 ⇒ −10d = −45 ⇒ d = 9/2
  Then b = −5/2 − 9/2 = −7
- Compute b + 3d:
  b + 3d = −7 + 3*(9/2) = −7 + 27/2 = 13/2</p>

<h2>Question 21:</h2>

<p>For x > 0, solve the equation (∛x)^(∛x) = x. Which of the following lists all solutions?
A) x = 1 only
B) x = 27 only
C) x = 1 and x = 27
D) Infinitely many values of x</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>Let y = ∛x, so y > 0 and x = y^3. The equation becomes y^y = y^3.
Take natural logarithms of both sides (valid for y > 0):
y ln y = 3 ln y
Bring all terms to one side and factor:
(y ln y) - (3 ln y) = 0
(ln y)(y - 3) = 0
Thus either ln y = 0 or y - 3 = 0.
- If ln y = 0, then y = 1 ⇒ x = y^3 = 1.
- If y - 3 = 0, then y = 3 ⇒ x = y^3 = 27.
Check both in the original equation: ∛1 = 1 and 1^1 = 1; ∛27 = 3 and 3^3 = 27. Both work.
Therefore, the solutions are x = 1 and x = 27.</p>

<h2>Question 22:</h2>

<p>At an animal shelter, the ratio of cats to dogs was 7:5. Some cats were adopted, and the same number of dogs were brought in, so the total number of animals remained the same. After these changes, the ratio of cats to dogs became 3:4. If the initial number of animals was less than 100, what was the initial number of animals?
A) 48
B) 60
C) 72
D) 84
E) 96</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>Let the initial numbers be cats = 7k and dogs = 5k, so the total is 12k.
Let x be the number of cats adopted and the same number of dogs added. Then the new counts are:
- Cats: 7k − x
- Dogs: 5k + x
The new ratio is (7k − x) : (5k + x) = 3 : 4. Set up the proportion:
(7k − x)/(5k + x) = 3/4
Cross-multiply:
4(7k − x) = 3(5k + x)
28k − 4x = 15k + 3x
13k = 7x
x = (13/7)k
For x to be an integer, k must be a multiple of 7. Let k = 7t, then the initial total is 12k = 12(7t) = 84t.
Given the initial total is less than 100, the only possible t is 1, so the initial number of animals is 84.
Check: If k = 7, cats = 49, dogs = 35, x = 13. New cats = 36, new dogs = 48, ratio = 3:4. Works.</p>

<h2>Question 23:</h2>

<p>A store sells two products, A and B. Last year, the revenue from A and B was in the ratio 3:2. This year, the price of A increased by 25% and the price of B decreased by 10%. The quantities sold remained the same as last year. To keep the total revenue equal to last year’s total, the manager decides to apply a single percentage discount to both products’ new prices. What discount, to the nearest tenth of a percent, should the manager apply?

A) 9.1%
B) 9.9%
C) 10.0%
D) 11.0%</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>Let last year’s total revenue be R. Since A and B contributed in the ratio 3:2, A contributed (3/5)R and B contributed (2/5)R.

After the price changes:
- A’s revenue scales by 1.25, so A contributes 1.25 × (3/5)R = 0.75R.
- B’s revenue scales by 0.90, so B contributes 0.90 × (2/5)R = 0.36R.

Total revenue after the price changes is 0.75R + 0.36R = 1.11R, which is an 11% increase over last year.

Applying a single discount of d% multiplies the new total by (1 − d). We want the final revenue to equal last year’s, so:
1.11 × (1 − d) = 1
1 − d = 1 / 1.11 = 100/111 ≈ 0.9009009
d ≈ 1 − 0.9009009 ≈ 0.099099 ≈ 9.9%</p>

<h2>Question 24:</h2>

<p>A bag is chosen at random with a fair coin. Bag A contains 3 red and 1 blue marble. Bag B contains 2 red and 2 blue marbles. From the chosen bag, two marbles are drawn without replacement. You are told that at least one of the marbles drawn is red. What is the probability that both marbles drawn are red?

A) 1/3
B) 4/11
C) 1/2
D) 5/12
E) 2/5</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>Let R be the event that both marbles are red, and L be the event that at least one marble is red.

Compute probabilities within each bag:
- Bag A: P(R | A) = (3/4)(2/3) = 1/2. P(L | A) = 1 because you cannot draw two blues (there is only one blue).
- Bag B: P(R | B) = (2/4)(1/3) = 1/6. P(L | B) = 1 − P(two blues) = 1 − (2/4)(1/3) = 1 − 1/6 = 5/6.

Since the coin is fair, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2. Use the law of total probability:
- P(R) = (1/2)(1/2) + (1/2)(1/6) = 1/4 + 1/12 = 1/3.
- P(L) = (1/2)(1) + (1/2)(5/6) = 1/2 + 5/12 = 11/12.

We want P(R | L) = P(R ∩ L) / P(L). Because R implies L, P(R ∩ L) = P(R). So:
P(R | L) = (1/3) / (11/12) = (1/3) × (12/11) = 4/11.</p>

- A) 2640 meters
- B) 3060 meters
- C) 3480 meters
- D) 51 meters</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>Distance traveled equals the area under the speed-time graph. Because speed is in m/s and time is in minutes, convert minutes to seconds by multiplying by 60.

Break the interval [0, 8] into the given segments and use average speed on each linear segment:
- From 0 to 2 minutes: speed increases linearly from 0 to 8 m/s.
  Average speed = (0 + 8) / 2 = 4 m/s; time = 2 × 60 = 120 s
  Distance = 4 × 120 = 480 m
- From 2 to 5 minutes: speed is constant at 8 m/s.
  Time = 3 × 60 = 180 s
  Distance = 8 × 180 = 1440 m
- From 5 to 7 minutes: speed decreases linearly from 8 to 4 m/s.
  Average speed = (8 + 4) / 2 = 6 m/s; time = 2 × 60 = 120 s
  Distance = 6 × 120 = 720 m
- From 7 to 8 minutes: speed increases linearly from 4 to 10 m/s.
  Average speed = (4 + 10) / 2 = 7 m/s; time = 1 × 60 = 60 s
  Distance = 7 × 60 = 420 m

Total distance = 480 + 1440 + 720 + 420 = 3060 meters.</p>

<h2>Question 26:</h2>

<p>What is the measure of the interior angle at D between line s and line q (the angle inside the band between the parallels)? 
A) 58 
B) 70 
C) 80 
D) 110</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>- Because p ∥ q, the angle each transversal makes with p on the interior side is equal to the corresponding interior angle it makes with q. In other words, the “inclination” of r or s relative to the parallel lines is consistent across the band.
- The acute angle between the two transversals r and s equals the absolute difference of the interior angles they make with the same parallel (here, with p on the interior side).
- Therefore, |(5x + 12) − (3x + 4)| = 52.
- Simplify: |2x + 8| = 52 → 2x + 8 = 52 (the positive case; the negative case would produce a negative angle measure for one of the marked interior angles). Thus x = 22.
- The interior angle s makes with p is 3x + 4 = 3(22) + 4 = 66 + 4 = 70 degrees.
- By parallel lines, the corresponding interior angle s makes with q at D is the same: 70 degrees.</p>

<h2>Question 27:</h2>

<p>In triangle ABC, AB = 8 and AC = 12. The internal angle bisector of angle A meets BC at D, and the median from A meets BC at M (so M is the midpoint of BC). If DM = 2, what is the length of BC?

A) 10
B) 15
C) 20
D) 25</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>- By the Angle Bisector Theorem, BD/DC = AB/AC = 8/12 = 2/3.
- Let BC = x. Then BD = (2/5)x and DC = (3/5)x.
- Since M is the midpoint of BC, BM = x/2.
- Points B, D, M, C are collinear on BC, so DM is the difference between BM and BD:
  DM = |BM − BD| = |(x/2) − (2x/5)| = |(5x − 4x)/10| = x/10.
- Given DM = 2, we have x/10 = 2, so x = 20.

Therefore, BC = 20.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>C) 20</p>

<h2>Question 28:</h2>

<p>In the diagram described, TA and TB are tangents to the circle from point T, with TA = TB = 10. The chord AB has length 12. What is the radius of the circle?
A) 6
B) 7.5
C) 8
D) 9</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>- Triangle TAB is isosceles with TA = TB = 10 and base AB = 12. Let θ = ∠ATB.
- By the Law of Cosines in triangle TAB:
  AB^2 = TA^2 + TB^2 − 2(TA)(TB)cos θ
  12^2 = 10^2 + 10^2 − 2(10)(10)cos θ
  144 = 200 − 200 cos θ
  cos θ = (200 − 144)/200 = 56/200 = 7/25.
- The angle formed by two tangents equals 180° minus the central angle AOB, so AOB = 180° − θ.
- The chord-length formula gives AB = 2R sin(AOB/2). Since AOB/2 = (180° − θ)/2 = 90° − θ/2, sin(AOB/2) = cos(θ/2).
  Therefore, AB = 2R cos(θ/2).
- Use the half-angle identity: cos(θ/2) = √[(1 + cos θ)/2] = √[(1 + 7/25)/2] = √[(32/25)/2] = √(16/25) = 4/5.
- Substitute into AB = 2R cos(θ/2):
  12 = 2R × (4/5) = (8/5)R ⇒ R = 12 × (5/8) = 60/8 = 7.5.</p>

<h2>Question 29:</h2>

<p>Triangle ABC has vertices A(−1, 2), B(5, −2), and C(1, 4) as shown. Let D be the foot of the perpendicular from C to line AB. What is the area of triangle ABC?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>- First, find the length of AB:
  - Vector AB = B − A = (5 − (−1), −2 − 2) = (6, −4).
  - |AB| = sqrt(6^2 + (−4)^2) = sqrt(36 + 16) = sqrt(52) = 2√13.
- Next, find the perpendicular distance from C to line AB (this is the altitude from C to AB):
  - Slope of AB = (−2 − 2)/(5 − (−1)) = −4/6 = −2/3.
  - Equation of AB through A(−1, 2): y − 2 = (−2/3)(x + 1) ⇒ y = (−2/3)x + 4/3.
  - In standard form: 2x + 3y − 4 = 0.
  - Distance from C(1, 4) to AB = |2(1) + 3(4) − 4| / sqrt(2^2 + 3^2) = |2 + 12 − 4| / sqrt(13) = 10/√13.
- Area = (1/2) × base × height = (1/2) × (2√13) × (10/√13) = 10.</p>

<h2>Question 30:</h2>

<p>Given the setup, what is the value of tan(θ) + cos(φ)?</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>- For the ladder triangle: hypotenuse = 20, vertical height = 12.
  - Using sine: sin(θ) = opposite/hypotenuse = 12/20 = 3/5.
  - Then cos(θ) = √(1 − sin²θ) = √(1 − (3/5)²) = √(1 − 9/25) = √(16/25) = 4/5.
  - Therefore tan(θ) = sin(θ)/cos(θ) = (3/5)/(4/5) = 3/4.
  - Alternatively, horizontal distance from wall = √(20² − 12²) = √(400 − 144) = √256 = 16, so tan(θ) = 12/16 = 3/4 (consistent).

- For the cable triangle: horizontal run = 16 (same base distance), vertical rise = 16.
  - The angle φ satisfies tan(φ) = 16/16 = 1, so φ = 45°, hence cos(φ) = √2/2.

- Sum: tan(θ) + cos(φ) = 3/4 + √2/2.</p>
<h3>Answers:</h3>
<p>- A) 7/8
- B) 3/4 + √2/2
- C) √3/2 + 3/4
- D) √2/2 + 4/5

Correct Answer: B) 3/4 + √2/2</p>
